    The data used for inference in this chapter is reconstructed from the publication by \citeauthorandlink{sanguineti_defining_2009}. Their work allowed us to infer about 103 early T-stage (T1 \& T2) patients and their ipsilateral nodal invovlement for the \glspl{lnl} I, II, III, and IV as reported by a pathological examination.

    At the time of writing the publication this chapter is based on \cite{ludwig_hidden_2021}, the datasets introduced in the \cref{chap:dataset_usz,chap:dataset_clb} were not yet available to us. They will be used in subsequent chapters, such as \cref{chap:graph} and \cref{chap:bilateral}.
