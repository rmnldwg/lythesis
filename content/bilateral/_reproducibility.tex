\begin{tcolorbox}[title=\faIcon{recycle} Reproducibility, parbox=false]
    Each of the three models investigated here are available in \repolink{lynference}, where we have run the respective pipeline, pushed it as a tagged commit to GitHub and published it as a release.

    The \href{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference#readme}{\faIcon{info-circle} \texttt{README.md}} file in this repository explains how one can download the data our pipeline runs produced and how to reproduce an experiment yourself.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model $\mathcal{M}_\text{ag}$: \href{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference/releases/tag/bilateral-v2}{\faIcon{tags} \texttt{bilateral-v2}}
        \item Model $\mathcal{M}_\alpha$: \href{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference/releases/tag/midline-with-mixing-v2}{\faIcon{tags} \texttt{midline-with-mixing-v2}}
        \item Model $\mathcal{M}_\text{full}$: \href{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference/releases/tag/midline-without-mixing-v2}{\faIcon{tags} \texttt{midline-without-mixing-v2}}
