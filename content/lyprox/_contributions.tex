    A \acrlong{gui} introduced in this chapter was conceptualized by \faIcon{user}~\textbf{Bertrand Pouymayou} \cite{pouymayou_analysis_2019}. He implemented a Python-based interface for local use. \faIcon{user}~\textbf{Roman Ludwig}~(me) then developed an online tool, freely accessible at \superhref{https://lyprox.org}{\faIcon{external-link-alt}~\texttt{https://lyprox.org}} based on this prototype using the web framework Django \cite{noauthor_django_2022} with substantially extended functionality.
