    Finally, in this chapter we will conclude our efforts to model lymphatic metastatic spread in \gls{hnscc} by combining all insights of previous chapters. Specifically, this means inferring the spread parameters for a model that has the extended graph of \cref{chap:graph} as underlying representation of the lymphatic network, and uses the results from \cref{chap:bilateral} to include the contralateral side.
    
    The complete model now includes the \glspl{lnl} I, II, III, IV, V and VII. They are connected as shown in \cref{fig:complete:graph}, based on the results in \cref{chap:graph}. For the treatment of the contralateral side, we decided to employ the model $\mathcal{M}_\alpha$ that was introduced in \cref{chap:bilateral}. We also called this the ``mixing model'', because it uses the mixing parameter $\alpha$ that sets the probability rates for spread from the tumor to the contralateral \glspl{lnl} in case of an extension over the mid-sagittal plane to be a linear combination between the ipsilateral base probability rates and the contralateral ones, when the tumor is lateralized:
    %
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde{b}_v^\text{c,e} = \alpha \cdot \tilde{b}_v^\text{i} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \tilde{b}_v^{\text{c},\centernot{\text{e}}}
    \end{equation}
\end{samepage}

It performed well in capturing the increased risk for contralateral metastasis, while only adding one parameter to the model.

By joining the six \glspl{lnl} and the bilateral mixing model, we end up with an \gls{hmm} of 19 parameters: Six for the ipsilateral, and six for the contralateral base probability rates (when the tumor does not extend over the mid-sagittal plane), the mixing parameter $\alpha$, five probability rates for the spread among \glspl{lnl} and lastly, one parameter for the late T-category time-prior.

For inference, we again used the \repolink[dfm]{emcee} Python package that implements ensemble-based \gls{mcmc} methods. We set the number of concurrent ``walkers'' to $20 \cdot k = 380$, where $k$ is the number of parameters. A proposal for a new parameer sample was generated with 80\% probability based on the differential evolution move by \citeauthorandlink{nelson_run_2013}, and with 20\% probability it used a differential evolution ``Snooker Move'' by \citeauthorandlink{ter_braak_differential_2008}. The early T-category's time-prior was fixed to a binomial distribution over eleven time-steps, meaning its support is $t \in \left[0, 1, 2, \ldots, 10\right]$, whereas the success probability $p_\text{early}$ was set to 30\%.

Sampling was then run until convergence, meaning that the estimate of the mean integrated auto-corralation of all 380 walkers, which was computed every 100 sampling steps, fulfills these conditions:

\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
    \item The estimate $\hat{\tau}$ needs to be stable, meaning
    \begin{equation}
        \left| 1 - \left( \frac{\hat{\tau}_{i-1}}{\hat{\tau}_i} \right) \right| \leq 0.075
    \end{equation}
    \item We only trust the estimate once it fulfills
    \begin{equation}
        30 \cdot \hat{\tau}_i \geq N
    \end{equation}
    where $N$ is the number of drawn samples.
\end{enumerate}

A plot of how the mean integrated auto-correlation estimate developed over the course of this sampling round is shown in \cref{fig:complete:acor}.

    }
    \label{fig:complete:acor}
\end{figure}

After the sampling converged, we drew another 250 samples, of which we discarded all but every fifth, leaving us with $50 \cdot 380 = 19\,000$ parameter samples. From these, we compute risks for different realistic scenarios to show how the resulting predictions may be used clinically for quantitatively informed decisions on \gls{ctv-n} definition. This will then also be compared to the currently established guidelines for \gls{ctv-n} definition to see where the potential for dose de-escalation in the elective treatment of e.g. \gls{opscc} arises.
