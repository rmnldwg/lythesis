\chapter{Complete Model of Bilateral Lymphatic Metastatic Spread}
\label{chap:complete}

Finally, in this chapter we will conclude our efforts to model lymphatic metastatic spread in \gls{hnscc} by combining all insights of previous chapters. Specifically, this means inferring the spread parameters for a model that has the extended graph of \cref{chap:graph} as underlying representation of the lymphatic network, and uses the results from \cref{chap:bilateral} to include the contralateral side.

We will compute risks for different realistic scenarios based on this complete model and show how the resulting predictions may be used clinically for quantitatively informed decisions on \acrfull{ctv-n} definition. This will then also be compared to the currently established guidelines for \gls{ctv-n} definition to see where the potential for dose de-escalation in the elective treatment of e.g. \gls{opscc} arises.
