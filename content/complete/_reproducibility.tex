    The model shown in this section is available in \repolink{lynference}, where we have run its main inference pipeline, as well as pipelines producing the different risk predictions, pushed them as tagged commits to \faIcon{github}~GitHub.

    The \superhref{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference\#readme}{\faIcon{info-circle} \texttt{README.md}} file in this repository explains how one can download the data our pipeline runs produced and how to reproduce an experiment yourself.
