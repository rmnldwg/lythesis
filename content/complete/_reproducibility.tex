    The model shown in this available in \repolink{lynference}, where we have run its main inference pipeline, as well as pipelines producing the different risk predictions, pushed them as a tagged commits to GitHub and published them as releases.

    The \href{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lynference#readme}{\faIcon{info-circle} \texttt{README.md}} file in this repository explains how one can download the data our pipeline runs produced and how to reproduce an experiment yourself.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model $\mathcal{M}_\text{ag}$: \lytag{bilateral-v3}
        \item Model $\mathcal{M}_\alpha$: \lytag{midline-with-mixing-v3}
        \item Model $\mathcal{M}_\text{full}$: \lytag{midline-without-mixing-v3}
