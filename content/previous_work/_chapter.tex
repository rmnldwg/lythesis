\chapter{Previous Work}
\label{chap:previous_work}

In this chapter we will introduce models that were previously developed to capture and predict lymphatic progression in \gls{hnscc}. This also includes the \gls{bn} model by \citeauthorandlink{pouymayou_bayesian_2019} we mentioned in the introduction, which served as a starting point to this work. This brief recap will introduce the notation and formalism that will be used throughout the rest of the thesis. Also, we will discuss the limitations and reasons to develop a new model and formalism.
