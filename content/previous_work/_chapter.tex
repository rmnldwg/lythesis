\chapter{Previous Work}
\label{chap:previous_work}

In this chapter I will introduce models that were previously developed to capture and predict lymphatic progression in \gls{hnscc}. This also includes a \gls{bn} model by \cite{pouymayou_bayesian_2019}, which served as a starting point to this work. This brief recap will also introduce the notation and formalism that will be used throughout the rest of the thesis.

After that, unrelated previous works will be mentioned and lastly, we will discuss the limitations and reasons to develop a new model and formalism.
