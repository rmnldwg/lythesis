\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

The work that we will present here is, at its core, methodological and hence somewhat abstract. In this first chapter we will therefore try to give the reader an introduction into the medicine and biology of what will later be treated in rather mathematical terms. However, as this is not written by medical doctors or biologists, it will be lacking the detail that any of these two experts might expect. The purpose of the sections below is to give an intuition into the formation and progression processes of the cancer type we will be dealing with. Beyond that we will also state our main goals here and give an overview over the structure of this work.
