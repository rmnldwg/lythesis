\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

The presented work is, at its core, methodological and abstract. In this introduction chapter we therefore give the reader an introduction into the medical and physiological background of what we later treat in mathematical terms. However, as this thesis is not written for medical doctors or biologists, it lacks the detail that experts with a medical background might expect. The purpose of the sections below is to give an intuition into the formation and progression processes of the cancer type we will be dealing with. Beyond that we also state our main goals here and give an overview over the structure of this work.
