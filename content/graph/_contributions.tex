\begin{tcolorbox}[title=\faIcon{users} Contributions, parbox=false]
    This section contains contributions by \faIcon{user} \textbf{Luca Franceschetti}, who wrote his Bachelor's thesis \cite{franceschetti_comparison_2022} on the topic under the supervision of \faIcon{user} \textbf{Roman Ludwig} (me) and \faIcon{user} \textbf{Jan Unkelbach} (\gls{pi} on the project).

    During his work in our group, Luca Franceschetti compared different graphs as basis for a unilateral \gls{hmm} for modelling lymphatic spread in \gls{opscc}. He mainly used cross-validation to compare the performance of different graphs. Below, I will cite some of his results, also test other graphs he did not consider and use the \gls{bic} as an additional measure of model performance.
