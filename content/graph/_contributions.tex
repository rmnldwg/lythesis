    This subsection contains contributions by \faIcon{user} \textbf{Luca Franceschetti}, who wrote his Bachelor's thesis \cite{franceschetti_comparison_2022} on the topic of assessing different underlying graph structures for our \gls{hmm} under the supervision of \faIcon{user} \textbf{Roman Ludwig} (me) and \faIcon{user} \textbf{Jan Unkelbach} (\gls{pi} on the project).

    During his work in our group, Luca Franceschetti compared different graphs that all added exactly two new arcs to the base graph we have introduced in the beginning of \cref{sec:graph:extended}. As a performance metric, he mainly computed out-of-sample likelihood during cross-validation and his work adds a valuable perspective to the task of model comparison.
