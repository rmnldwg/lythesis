    \faIcon{user}~\textbf{Laurence Bauwens}~et~al.\cite{bauwens_prevalence_2021} extracted the data described here and published a study on the prevalence of lymph node metastases in \gls{opscc}. The raw data was not provided with the original publication, but \faIcon{user} \textbf{Vincent Gr√©goire}, the \gls{pi} on the publication, kindly shared it with us and allowed us to analyze it, and make it publicly available.

    \faIcon{user}~\textbf{Roman Ludwig}~(me) converted the data into the same format as our dataset from \cref{chap:dataset_usz}, analyzed both the differences to our dataset, as well as this data's sensitivity and specificity, which has not been done by the authors of the original article, and made the data publicly available.
