    The dataset this chapter concerns itself with was extracted and published by \citeauthorandlink{bauwens_prevalence_2021}. The raw data was not provided with the publication, but \faIcon{user} \textbf{Vincent Gr√©goire}, the \gls{pi} on the mentioned publication, kindly sent it to us and allowed us to host it on \href{https://lyprox.org}{\faIcon{external-link-alt} LyProX}

    Below I will briefly introduce the underlying cohort of patients and why the data is valuable. This will also allow a better understanding of the chapters using this data. My contribution comes in the form of normalizing the data into the same format as our dataset from \cref{chap:dataset_usz}, and analyzing sensitivity and specificity which has not been done by the authors of the original article.
