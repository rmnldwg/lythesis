    \faIcon{user}~\textbf{Laurence Bauwens}~et~al.\cite{bauwens_prevalence_2021} extracted the data described here and used it to publish a study on the prevalence of lymph node metastases in \gls{opscc}. The raw data was not provided with the publication, but \faIcon{user} \textbf{Vincent Gr√©goire}, the \gls{pi} on the mentioned publication, kindly sent it to us and allowed us to analyze it, as well as making it publicly available.

    \faIcon{user}~\textbf{Roman Ludwig}~(me) normalized the data into the same format as our dataset from \cref{chap:dataset_usz}, analyzed both the differences to our dataset, as well as this data's sensitivity and specificity, which has not been done by the authors of the original article, and made the data publicly available.
