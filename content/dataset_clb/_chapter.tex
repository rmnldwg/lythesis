In addition to the \gls{usz} dataset introduced in the previous \cref{chap:dataset_usz}, data from another patient cohort, extracted at the \gls{clb} in France, was used in this thesis. It was kindly provided to us by Vincent Gr√©goire and is based on the publication by \citeauthorandlink{bauwens_prevalence_2021}.

The \gls{clb} dataset, like our \gls{usz} data, reports involvement information per \gls{lnl} for \gls{opscc} patients. But unlike the \gls{usz} cohort, all patients at the \gls{clb} were surgically treated and resected \glspl{lnl} were examined by a pathologist. Hence, in addition to a clinical diagnosis, the \gls{clb} dataset contains histopathological information on the metastatic state of each resected \gls{lnl}. This represents an invaluable addition to our \gls{usz} dataset, as pathology information is the gold standard of assessing nodal involvement. Hence, the reports contained in the \gls{clb} data will be treated by us as if they were the ground truth.

This chapter will detail how this data was acquired, what information is contained in it and how it compares to the previously discussed \gls{usz} data.
