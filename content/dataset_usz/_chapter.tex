One critical aspect of our effort to model and predict the lymphatic tumor progression is the data we use to train the model. As previously explained, our model essentially consumes tables with rows of patients and columns involvement by \gls{lnl}. Data in this relatively simple format has been extracted in the past to create studies like \cite{candela_patterns_1990} or \cite{shah_patterns_1990}. However, the authors published only statistics of the data -- e.g. the prevalence of involvement -- summarizing without making the data available in its raw format. From these statistics it is -- with one exception \cite{sanguineti_defining_2009} -- usually not possible to reconstruct the correlations between the involvement of \glspl{lnl}.

With almost no usable data, of course, our methodology for modelling lymphatic progression cannot be tested or applied. So, we decided to start at the \gls{usz} to extract patterns of lymphatic progression in all patients with newly diagnosed \gls{opscc} between 2013 and 2019. We then not only used that data for modelling lymphatic progression, but also published it freely, hoping that other researchers might find it useful and that it may even motivate them to share their data in a similar fashion in the future.
