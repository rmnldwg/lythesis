    The full dataset is available as a \acrshort{csv}-file via the Data-in-Brief article linked to this publication \cite{ludwig_dataset_2022} and in the repository \repolink{lyDATA} in a folder named \faIcon{folder}~\texttt{2021-usz-oropharynx}. In addition, the dataset has been archived and given a persistent identifier: \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6024778}.

    It can also be downloaded from our \gls{gui} \inlinelyproxlogo{}, where it is listed under the tab ``Datasets'', alongside our data. On that website, one may also explore the dataset interactively in the ``Data Viewer'' tab, which is described in the next section.
