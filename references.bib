	abstract = {The minor capsid protein L2 of papillomaviruses exhibits multiple functions during viral entry including membrane interaction. Information on the protein is scarce, because of its high tendency of aggregation. We determined suitable conditions to produce a functional human papillomavirus ({HPV}) 16 L2 protein and thereby provide the opportunity for extensive in vitro analysis with respect to structural and biochemical information on L2 proteins and mechanistic details in viral entry. We produced the L2 protein of high-risk {HPV} 16 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and purified the protein under denaturing conditions. A successive buffer screen resulted in suitable conditions for the biophysical characterization of 16L2. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the refolded protein showed a homogenous monomeric species. Furthermore, refolded 16L2 shows secondary structure elements. The N-terminal region including the proposed transmembrane region of 16L2 shows alpha-helical characteristics. However, overall 16L2 appears largely unstructured. Refolded 16L2 is capable of binding to {DNA} indicating that the putative {DNA}-binding regions are accessible in refolded 16L2. Further the refolded protein interacts with liposomal membranes presumably via the proposed transmembrane region at neutral {pH} without structural changes. This indicates that 16L2 can initially interact with membranes via pre-existing structural features.},

	abstract = {The group testing problem concerns discovering a small number of defective items within a large population by performing tests on pools of items. A test is positive if the pool contains at least one defective, and negative if it contains no defectives. This is a sparse inference problem with a combinatorial flavour, with applications in medical testing, biology, telecommunications, information technology, data science, and more. In this monograph, we survey recent developments in the group testing problem from an information-theoretic perspective. We cover several related developments: efficient algorithms with practical storage and computation requirements, achievability bounds for optimal decoding methods, and algorithm-independent converse bounds. We assess the theoretical guarantees not only in terms of scaling laws, but also in terms of the constant factors, leading to the notion of the \{{\textbackslash}em rate\} of group testing, indicating the amount of information learned per test. Considering both noiseless and noisy settings, we identify several regimes where existing algorithms are provably optimal or near-optimal, as well as regimes where there remains greater potential for improvement. In addition, we survey results concerning a number of variations on the standard group testing problem, including partial recovery criteria, adaptive algorithms with a limited number of stages, constrained test designs, and sublinear-time algorithms.},

	title = {Detailed patient-individual reporting of lymph node involvement in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with an online interface},
	abstract = {Purpose/Objective: Whereas the prevalence of lymph node level ({LNL}) involvement in head \& neck squamous cell carcinomas ({HNSCC}) has been reported, the details of lymphatic progression patterns are insufficiently quantified. In this study, we investigate how the risk of metastases in each {LNL} depends on the involvement of upstream {LNLs}, T-category, {HPV} status and other risk factors. 
Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal {HNSCC} treated at a single institution, resulting in a dataset of 287 patients. For all patients, involvement of {LNLs} I-{VII} was recorded individually based on available diagnostic modalities ({PET}, {MR}, {CT}, {FNA}) together with clinicopathological factors. To analyze the dataset, a web-based graphical user interface ({GUI}) was developed, which allows querying the number of patients with a certain combination of co-involved {LNLs} and tumor characteristics.
Results: The full dataset and {GUI} is part of the publication. Selected findings are: Ipsilateral level {IV} was involved in 27\% of patients with level {II} and {III} involvement, but only in 2\% of patients with level {II} but not {III} involvement. Prevalence of involvement of ipsilateral levels {II}, {III}, {IV}, V was 79\%, 34\%, 7\%, 3\% for early T-category patients (T1/T2) and 85\%, 50\%, 17\%, 9\% for late T-category (T3/T4), quantifying increasing involvement with T-category. Contralateral levels {II}, {III}, {IV} were involved in 41\%, 19\%, 4\% and 12\%, 3\%, 2\% for tumors for tumors with and without midline extension, respectively. T-stage dependence of {LNL} involvement was more pronounced in {HPV} negative than positive tumors, but overall involvement was similar. Ipsilateral level {VII} was involved in 14\% and 6\% of patients with primary tumors in the tonsil and the base of tongue, respectively.
Conclusions: Detailed quantification of {LNL} involvement in {HNSCC} depending on involvement of upstream {LNLs} and clinicopathological factors may allow for further personalization of {CTV}-N definition in the future.},

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of {RPLN} involvement upon outcomes. A single-centre retrospective analysis of 402 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma treated nonsurgically between 2010 and 2017 was performed. All had a baseline 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ({FDG}) {PET}-{CT} and contrast-enhanced {MRI} and/or {CT}. {RPLN} status was determined by radiology review of cases with reported abnormal {RPLN}. Multivariate backwards logistic regression was used to examine impact on outcomes of factors. Abnormal {RPLNs} were identified in 40/402 (10\%) of patients. Median follow up was 42.9 months. {RPLN} involvement was associated with inferior 3 year outcomes for overall survival ({OS}) (67.1\% vs. 79.1\%, p = 0.006) and distant metastases-free survival ({DMFS}) (73.9\% versus 88.0\%, p = 0.011), with no significant difference in local control (81.6\% vs. 87.7\%, p = 0.154) or regional control (80.7\% vs. 85.4\%, p = 0.252). On multivariate analysis abnormal {RPLN}, no concurrent chemotherapy and ongoing smoking were associated with inferior {DMFS} and {OS}, while advanced T stage was also associated with inferior {OS}. In summary, {RPLN} involvement, present in 10\% of patients, was an independent prognostic factor for the development of distant disease failure translating into inferior {OS}. These findings need confirmation in future studies.},

Stellar is a new global payment network that can directly transfer digital money anywhere in the world in seconds. The key innovation is a secure transaction mechanism across untrusted intermediaries, using a new Byzantine agreement protocol called {SCP}. With {SCP}, each institution specifies other institutions with which to remain in agreement; through the global interconnectedness of the financial system, the whole network then agrees on atomic transactions spanning arbitrary institutions, with no solvency or exchange-rate risk from intermediary asset issuers or market makers. We present {SCP}’s model, protocol, and formal verification; describe the Stellar payment network; and finally evaluate Stellar empirically through benchmarks and our experience with several years of production use.},

	abstract = {Vibratory stimuli are thought to have the potential to promote neural and/or muscular (re)conditioning. This has been well described for whole-body vibration ({WBV}), which is commonly used as a training method to improve strength and/or functional abilities. Yet, this technique may present some limitations, especially in clinical settings where patients are unable to maintain an active position during the vibration exposure. Thus, a local vibration ({LV}) technique, which consists of applying portable vibrators directly over the tendon or muscle belly without active contribution from the participant, may present an alternative to {WBV}. The purpose of this narrative review is (1) to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature related to the acute and chronic neuromuscular changes associated with {LV}, and (2) to show that {LV} training may be an innovative and efficient alternative method to the ‘classic’ training programs, including in the context of muscle deconditioning prevention or rehabilitation. An acute {LV} application (one bout of 20–60 min) may be considered as a significant neuromuscular workload, as demonstrated by an impairment of force generating capacity and {LV}-induced neural changes. Accordingly, it has been reported that a training period of {LV} is efficient in improving muscular performance over a wide range of training (duration, number of session) and vibration (frequency, amplitude, site of application) parameters. The functional improvements are principally triggered by adaptations within the central nervous system. A model illustrating the current research on {LV}-induced adaptations is provided.},

Participants: 19 healthy, moderately active subjects. Interventions: After a 30-min bout of full-body exercise, subjects received either an active or a sham vibration intervention. The active vibration intervention was performed bilaterally over the muscle bellies of the triceps surae, quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteals. At least 1 wk later, subjects repeated the bout, receiving the other vibration intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Static balance, dynamic balance, power, and self-reported pain were measured at baseline, after the vibration intervention, and 24 h postexercise. Results: After the bout of exercise, subjects had reduced static and dynamic balance and increased self-reported pain regardless of vibration intervention. There were no differences between outcome measures between the active and sham vibration conditions.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effects of whole body vibration ({WBV}) and local muscle vibration ({LMV}) on quadriceps function after experimental knee effusion (ie, simulated pathology).
Design
Randomized controlled trial.
Setting
Research laboratory.
Participants
Healthy volunteers (N=43) were randomized to {WBV} (n=14), {LMV} (n=16), or control (n=13) groups.
Interventions
Saline was injected into the knee to induce quadriceps arthrogenic muscle inhibition ({AMI}). All groups then performed isometric squats while being exposed to {WBV}, {LMV}, or no vibration (control).
Main Outcome Measures
Quadriceps function was assessed at baseline, immediately after effusion, and immediately and 5 minutes after each intervention ({WBV}, {LMV}, control) via voluntary peak torque ({VPT}) and the central activation ratio ({CAR}) during maximal isometric knee extension on a multifunction dynamometer.
Results
The {CAR} improved in the {WBV} (11.4\%, P=.021) and {LMV} (7.3\%, P{\textless}.001) groups immediately postintervention, but they did not improve in the control group. Similarly, {VPT} increased by 16.5\% (P=.021) in the {WBV} group and 23\% (P=.078) in the {LMV} group immediately postintervention, but it did not increase in the control group. The magnitudes of improvements in the {CAR} and {VPT} did not differ between the {WBV} and {LMV} groups.
Conclusions
Quadriceps {AMI} is a common complication following knee pathology that produces quadriceps dysfunction and increases the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Quadriceps strengthening after knee pathology is often ineffective because of {AMI}. {WBV} and {LMV} improve quadriceps function equivocally after simulated knee pathology, effectively minimizing quadriceps {AMI}. Therefore, these stimuli may be used to enhance quadriceps strengthening, therefore improving the efficacy of rehabilitation and reducing the risk of osteoarthritis.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-wk local vibration training ({LVT}) program on functional and corticospinal properties of dorsiflexor muscles. Forty-four young subjects were allocated to a training ({VIB}, n = 22) or control ({CON}, n = 22) group. The {VIB} group performed twenty-four 1-h sessions (3 sessions/wk) of 100-Hz vibration applied to the right tibialis anterior. Both legs were tested in each group before training ({PRE}), after 4 ({MID}) and 8 ({POST}) wk of training, and 2 wk after training ({POST}2W). Maximal voluntary contraction ({MVC}) torque was assessed, and transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) was used to evaluate cortical voluntary activation ({VATMS}), motor evoked potential ({MEP}), cortical silent period ({CSP}), and input-output curve parameters. {MVC} was significantly increased for {VIB} at {MID} for right and left legs [+7.4\% (P = 0.001) and +6.2\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively] and remained significantly greater than {PRE} at {POST} [+12.0\% (P {\textless} 0.001) and +10.1\% (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively]. {VATMS} was significantly increased for right and left legs at {MID} [+4.4\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and +4.7\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively] and at {POST} [+4.9\% (P = 0.001) and +6.2\% (P = 0.001), respectively]. These parameters remained enhanced in both legs at {POST}2W. {MEP} and {CSP} recorded during {MVC} and input-output curve parameters did not change at any time point for either leg. Despite no changes in excitability or inhibition being observed, {LVT} seems to be a promising method to improve strength through an increase of maximal voluntary activation, i.e., neural adaptations. Local vibration may thus be further considered for clinical or aging populations.

{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} The effects of a local vibration training program on cortical voluntary activation measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation were assessed for the first time in dorsiflexors, a functionally important muscle group. We observed that training increased maximal voluntary strength likely because of the strong and repeated activation of Ia spindle afferents during vibration training that led to changes in the cortico-motoneuronal pathway, as demonstrated by the increase in cortical voluntary activation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Currently, elective clinical target volume ({CTV}-N) definition for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) is mostly based on the prevalence of nodal involvement for a given tumor location. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model for lymphatic metastatic spread that can quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in lymph node levels ({LNL}) given the location of macroscopic metastases and T-category. This may allow for further personalized {CTV}-N definition based on an individual patient’s state of disease. We model the patient's state of metastatic lymphatic progression as a collection of hidden binary random variables that indicate the involvement of {LNLs}. In addition, each {LNL} is associated with observed binary random variables that indicate whether macroscopic metastases are detected. A hidden Markov model ({HMM}) is used to compute the probabilities of transitions between states over time. The underlying graph of the {HMM} represents the anatomy of the lymphatic drainage system. Learning of the transition probabilities is done via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and is based on a dataset of {HNSCC} patients in whom involvement of individual {LNLs} was reported. The model is demonstrated for ipsilateral metastatic spread in oropharyngeal {HNSCC} patients. We demonstrate the model's capability to quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in levels {III} and {IV}, depending on whether macroscopic metastases are observed in the upstream levels {II} and {III}, and depending on T-category. In conclusion, the statistical model of lymphatic progression may inform future, more personalized, guidelines on which {LNL} to include in the elective {CTV}. However, larger multi-institutional datasets for model parameter learning are required for that.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Bilateral elective nodal irradiation ({ENI}) remains the standard treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}). Unilateral {ENI} could reduce treatment toxicity and improve health-related quality-of-life ({HRQOL}). This prospective proof-of-principle trial ({NCT}02572661) investigated the feasibility, safety and clinical beneﬁts of {SPECT}/{CT}-guided {ENI} of the node-negative contralateral neck. Materials and methods: Patients with lateralized T1-3N0-2bM0 {HNSCC} of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx underwent {SPECT}/{CT} after peritumoral 99mTc-nanocolloid injection. Patients without contralateral lymph drainage received ipsilateral {ENI} only. If lymph drainage to only one contralateral hot spot was visible, {ENI} to the contralateral neck would be limited to only the level containing the hot spot. The primary endpoint was the incidence of contralateral regional failure ({CRF}) at 2 years. Toxicity and {HRQOL} were compared with a 1:1 matched historical cohort that received standard bilateral {ENI} (B-{ENI}) with identical planning and treatment techniques.
Results: Fifty patients were treated with {SPECT}/{CT}-guided {ENI}. After a median follow-up of 33 months (range 18–45), {CRF} was observed in one patient (2\%; 95\% conﬁdence interval: 0–6\%). Compared to the matched B-{ENI} group, patients treated with {SPECT}/{CT}-guided {ENI} had signiﬁcantly lower incidences of grade !2 dysphagia (54\% vs. 82\%; p {\textless} 0.001), tube feeding (10\% vs. 50\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and late grade !2 xerostomia (9\% vs. 54\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Signiﬁcant and clinically relevant {HRQOL} beneﬁts of {SPECT}/{CTguided} {ENI} were observed on the {EORTC} {QLQ}-C30 summary score, and {QLQ}-{HN}35 swallowing and dry mouth subscales.
Conclusion: {SPECT}/{CT}-guided {ENI} is associated with a low risk of contralateral regional failure. Compared to B-{ENI}, {SPECT}/{CT}-guided {ENI} signiﬁcantly reduces dysphagia, feeding tube placement, and late xerostomia and improves {HRQOL}.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ({OP}-{SCC}), the prevalence and distribution of clinical and pathological lymph node metastasis in the neck have been extensively reported. It served as the basis for consensus recommendations on the selection of the lymph node levels in the neck requiring a treatment. The objective of the study is to compare the prevalence and distribution of neck node metastases in {HPV}+ and {HPV}- {OP}-{SCC} from a large series of patients with {OP}-{SCC} who underwent a cervical lymph-node dissection ({LND}) as part of their treatment.
{METHODS}: The study concentrated on {OP}-{SCC} patients treated by various neck node dissection ({LND}) procedures from January 2014 to December 2018 in 3 French institutions. Patients with prior head and neck cancer, prior neck surgery, the use of induction chemotherapy, or patients with carcinoma of unknown primary were excluded. {HPV}-status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry. For each patient, the clinical and the pathological nodal status, as well as the distribution of the positive nodes in each neck level (from Ia to V) were reported.
{RESULTS}: Two-hundred and sixty-three patients were included (126 p16-negative (p16-), and 137 p16-positive (p16+). The rate of clinical positive node ({cN}+) reached 54\% and 88.3\% in the p16- and p16+ groups, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001); the corresponding rate of pathological positive node ({pN}+) reached 61.9\% and 91.2\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Regarding the clinical lymph node distribution, in p16+ patients, more positive nodes were observed in the ipsilateral level {IV} (p = 0.003), and less positive nodes were observed in the contralateral levels {III} and {IV} (p = 0.003 and p = 0.045, respectively). Regarding the pathologic lymph node distribution in the ipsilateral neck, in the {cN}0 patients, no significant difference was observed between p16- and p16+ patients (p = 0.33 to 1); in the {cN}+ patients, the nodes were distributed in levels Ib, {II}, {III}, {IV} and V without differences between the p16- and the p16+ patients. In the contralateral neck of p16- patients, nodes metastases were mainly observed in levels {II}, {III} and {IV}, whereas for the p16+ patients, positive nodes were only observed in level {II} (p = 0.03).
{CONCLUSION}: This study demonstrated the higher prevalence of {cN}+ and {pN}+ in p16+ {OP}-{SCC} patients, but without meaningful difference in the distribution of the lymph node drainage between p16- and p16+ {OP}-{SCC}. It indicates that no difference should be made between p16- and p16+ patients regarding the extend of neck treatment.},

It was suggested that inverse planning could be based on a probability distribution of patient geometries instead of a single snap shot. However, this concept is connected to two intrinsic problems: ﬁrst, this probability distribution has to be estimated from only a few images; and second, the distribution is only sparsely sampled over the treatment course due to a ﬁnite number of fractions. In the current work, we develop new concepts of inverse planning which account for these two problems.},

	abstract = {We conduct a theoretical study of various solution methods for the adaptive fractionation problem. The two messages of this paper are: (i) dynamic programming ({DP}) is a useful framework for adaptive radiation therapy, particularly adaptive fractionation, because it allows us to assess how close to optimal different methods are, and (ii) heuristic methods proposed in this paper are near-optimal, and therefore, can be used to evaluate the best possible benefit of using an adaptive fraction size. The essence of adaptive fractionation is to increase the fraction size when the tumor and organ-at-risk ({OAR}) are far apart (a "favorable" anatomy) and to decrease the fraction size when they are close together. Given that a fixed prescribed dose must be delivered to the tumor over the course of the treatment, such an approach results in a lower cumulative dose to the {OAR} when compared to that resulting from standard fractionation. We first establish a benchmark by using the {DP} algorithm to solve the problem exactly. In this case, we characterize the structure of an optimal policy, which provides guidance for our choice of heuristics. We develop two intuitive, numerically near-optimal heuristic policies, which could be used for more complex, high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, one of the heuristics requires only a statistic of the motion probability distribution, making it a reasonable method for use in a realistic setting. Numerically, we find that the amount of decrease in dose to the {OAR} can vary significantly (5 - 85\%) depending on the amount of motion in the anatomy, the number of fractions, and the range of fraction sizes allowed. In general, the decrease in dose to the {OAR} is more pronounced when: (i) we have a high probability of large tumor-{OAR} distances, (ii) we use many fractions (as in a hyper-fractionated setting), and (iii) we allow large daily fraction size deviations.},

Among 295 patients suspected of coronary artery disease, as independently determined by coronary angiography, we assessed variation in sensitivity and specificity according to patient history, physical examination, exercise test results, and disease severity in 207 patients with and 88 patients without coronary artery disease, respectively. The sensitivity varied substantially according to sex (women 30\% and men 64\%), systolic blood pressure at baseline (53\% to 65\%), expected workload (50\% to 64\%), systolic blood pressure at peak exercise (50\% to 67\%), relative workload (33\% to 66\%), and number of diseased vessels (39\% to 77\%). The specificity varied across subgroups of sex (men 89\% and women 97\%) and relative workload (85\% to 98\%). The likelihood ratio varied (3.8 to 17.0) across the same patient subgroups, as did the sensitivity. As each population tends to be heterogeneous with respect to patient characteristics, no single level of these parameters can be given that is adequate for all subgroups. Use of these parameters as a basis for calculating diagnostic probabilities in individual patients using Bayes' theorem has serious limitations.},

Obtaining large number of probabilities from domain experts is too expensive and too time demanding in practice. A widely accepted solution to this problem is the assumption of independence of causal influences ({ICI}) which allows for parametric models that define conditional probability distributions using only a number of parameters that is linear in the number of causes. {ICI} models, such as the noisy-{OR} and the noisy-{AND} gates, have been widely used by practitioners. In this paper we propose {PICI}, probabilistic {ICI}, an extension of the {ICI} assumption that leads to more expressive parametric models. We provide examples of three {PICI} models and demonstrate how they can cope with a com- bination of positive and negative influences, something that is hard for noisy-{OR} and noisy-{AND} gates.},

For primary sites other than the tongue, metastasis developed initially in a node(s) in the first drainage group (level I or {II}) with progressive involvement of neighbouring nodes (‘overflow’). Simultaneous bilateral metastases were seen in some tumours of the floor of mouth, tongue and oropharynx which involved the midline. An erratic distribution of metastases suggestive of ‘fast-tracking’ (skip lesions and peppering) was only seen in tongue tumours. The pattern of metastatic spread indicates that level {IV} nodes must be included in staging and therapeutic neck dissections in tongue cancer.

There is no method of imaging or other examination that will detect microscopic foci of metastatic disease in cervical lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of neck specimens reveals the incidence of occult metastases to be higher than revealed by light microscopy with ordinary hematoxylin and eosin staining. The neck may be treated electively by surgery or irradiation. Surgery has the advantage of permitting pathological staging of the neck, avoiding unnecessary radiation treatment and indicating cases where adjuvant therapy should be employed. As oral cavity cancer rarely metastasizes to level V, a radical or modiﬁed radical neck dissection of all ﬁve node levels is not necessary. Selective dissection of levels I–{III} (“supraomohyoid neck dissection”) is the usual procedure of choice for elective dissection of the neck. Most of the relatively small number of isolated metastasis to level {IV} are from primary tumours of the tongue, which are known to produce “skip” metastases. Thus an “extended supraomohyoid neck dissection” of levels I–{IV} is recommended by some authors for elective treatment of the neck in tongue cancer. A number of recent prospective multi-institutional studies have demonstrated that sublevel {IIB} is rarely involved with isolated metastasis from oral cavity primary tumours, except from some tongue cancers. Thus it is justiﬁable to omit dissection of sublevel {IIB} in elective treatment of most cases of oral cavity cancer. Bilateral neck dissection should be performed in elective treatment of tumours involving midline structures, and in patients with ipsilateral neck metastasis.},

	abstract = {Background: The characteristics of cervical lymphatic metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma ({NPC}) are not completely understood. As such, radiotherapy to the entire lymphatic of the neck bilaterally has been empirically practiced even in early stage disease, although not supported by clinical evidence. We studied the pattern and probability of nodal metastasis through a meta-analysis of published evidences, with an aim to establish an evidence-based guideline for selecting and delineation of clinical target volume of neck lymphatics for conformation radiation for {NPC}.
Methods: A literature search yielded an initial 411 original articles, and 13 studies with 2920 {NPC} cases staged via {MRI} were included in this analysis. The occurrence of nodal metastasis was calculated and analyzed according to the respective regional nodal levels.
Results: 85\% of {NPC} cases presented with lymphadenopathy. The most commonly involved regions include retropharyngeal (69\%) and level {II} lymph nodes (70\%). The overall probability of levels {III}, {IV}, and V nodal involvement are 45\%, 11\%, and 27\%, respectively. Low-risk node groups included the supraclavicular, levels {IA}/{IB} and {VI} nodes, and parotid nodes with involvement rates at 3\%, 0\%, 3\%, 0\%, and 1\%, respectively. Nodal metastases followed an orderly pattern and the probability of “skip” metastasis between levels varied between 0.5-7.9\%.
Conclusions: Lymph node metastasis in {NPC} follows a predictable and orderly pattern. The rarity of metastasis in certain nodal groups and “skip” metastasis suggest that reduced treatment volume is feasible in conformal radiotherapy for {NPC}.},

The 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the {NO} neck (N = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the N+ neck (N = 259). Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. This revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels {II}, {III}, and {IV} for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. Isolated ?skip? metastases outside of levels {II}, {III}, or {IV} occurred in only 1 patient (0.3\%). Otherwise, level I or V involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, N2 disease). These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in {NO} patients. Furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.},

Over the past few years, two proposals—the so-called Brussels guidelines from Grégoire et al., and the so-called Rotterdam guidelines from Nowak et al.—emerged from the literature for the delineation of the neck node levels. Detailed examination of these proposals however revealed some important discrepancies. Materials and methods: Within this framework, the Brussels and Rotterdam groups decided to review their guidelines and derive a common set of recommendations for delineation of neck node levels. This proposal was then discussed with representatives of major cooperative groups in Europe ({DAHANCA}, {EORTC}, {GORTEC}) and in North America ({NCIC}, {RTOG}), which, after some additional refinements, have endorsed them. The objective of the present article is to present the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in the node-negative neck. Results and conclusions: First a short discussion of the discrepancies between the previous Brussels and the Rotterdam guidelines is presented. The general philosophy of the consensus guidelines and the methodology used to resolve the various discrepancies are then described. The consensus proposal is then presented and representative {CTVs} that are consistent with these guidelines are illustrated on {CT} sections. Last, the limitations of the consensus guidelines are discussed and some concerns about the direct applications of these guidelines to the node-positive neck and the post-operative neck are described.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines regarding the delineation of the neck node levels (Radiother Oncol, 2003; 69: 227–36). These recommendations were applicable for the node-negative and the N1-neck, but were found too restrictive for the node-positive and the post-operative neck.
Patients and methods
In this framework, using the previous recommendations as a backbone, new guidelines have been proposed taking into account the specificities of the node-positive and the post-operative neck.
Results
Inclusion of the retrostyloid space cranially and the supra-clavicular fossa caudally is proposed in case of neck nodes (defined radiologically or on the surgical specimen) located in levels {II}, and {IV} or Vb, respectively. When extra-capsular rupture is suspected (on imaging) or demonstrated on the pathological specimen, adjacent muscles should also be included in the {CTV}. For node(s) located at the boundary between contiguous levels (e.g. levels {II} and Ib), these two levels should be delineated. In the post-operative setting, the entire ‘surgical bed’ should be included. Last, the retropharyngeal space should be delineated in case of positive neck from pharyngeal tumors.
Conclusions
The objective of the manuscript is to give a comprehensive description of the new set of guidelines for {CTV} delineation in the node-positive neck and the post-operative neck, with a complementary atlas of the new anatomical structures to be included.},

In 2006, these guidelines were extended to include the characteristics of the node positive and the post-operative neck (Radiother Oncol, 79: 15–20, 2006). These guidelines did not fully address all nodal regions and some of the anatomic descriptions were ambiguous, thereby limiting consistent use of the recommendations. In this framework, a task force comprising opinion leaders in the field of head and neck radiation oncology from European, Asian, Australia/New Zealand and North American clinical research organizations was formed to review and update the previously published guidelines on nodal level delineation. Based on the nomenclature proposed by the American Head and Neck Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and in alignment with the {TNM} atlas for lymph nodes in the neck, 10 node groups (some being divided into several levels) were defined with a concise description of their main anatomic boundaries, the normal structures juxtaposed to these nodes, and the main tumor sites at risk for harboring metastases in those levels. Emphasis was placed on those levels not adequately considered previously (or not addressed at all); these included the lower neck (e.g. supraclavicular nodes), the scalp (e.g. retroauricular and occipital nodes), and the face (e.g. buccal and parotid nodes). Lastly, peculiarities pertaining to the node-positive and the post-operative clinical scenarios were also discussed. In conclusion, implementation of these guidelines in the daily practice of radiation oncology should contribute to the reduction of treatment variations from clinician to clinician and facilitate the conduct of multi-institutional clinical trials.},

	abstract = {The head and neck contain many critical, noninvolved structures in close vicinity to the targets. The tightly conformal doses produced by intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}), and the lack of internal organ motion in the head and neck, provide the potential for organ sparing and improved tumor irradiation. Many studies of treatment planning for head and neck cancer have demonstrated the dosimetric superiority of {IMRT} over conventional techniques in these respects. The initial results of clinical studies demonstrate reduced xerostomia. They suggest an improvement in tumor control, which needs to be verified in larger studies and longer follow-up. Critical issues for successful outcome of head and neck {IMRT} are accurate selection of the neck lymph nodes that require adjuvant treatment, and accurate delineation on the planning computed tomography ({CT}) of the lymph-node bearing areas and subclinical disease adjoining the gross tumor.

	abstract = {Purpose: We present the guidelines for target volume determination and delineation of head-and-neck lymph nodes based on the analysis of the patterns of nodal failure in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy ({IMRT}). Methods and Materials: Data pertaining to the natural course of nodal metastasis for each head-and-neck cancer subsite were reviewed. A system was established to provide guidance for nodal target volume determination and delineation. Following these guidelines, 126 patients (52 definitive, 74 postoperative) were treated between February 1997 and December 2000 with {IMRT} for head-and-neck cancer. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 12–55), and the patterns of nodal failure were analyzed. Results: These guidelines define the nodal target volume based on the location of the primary tumor and the probability of microscopic metastasis to the ipsilateral and contralateral (Level I–V) nodal regions. Following these guidelines, persistent or recurrent nodal disease was found in 6 (12\%) of 52 patients receiving definitive {IMRT}, and 7 (9\%) of 74 patients receiving postoperative {IMRT} had failure in the nodal region. Conclusion: On the basis of our clinical experience in implementing inverse-planning {IMRT} for head-and-neck cancer, we present guidelines using a simplified, but clinically relevant, method for nodal target volume determination and delineation. The intention was to provide a foundation that enables different institutions to exchange clinical experiences in head-and-neck {IMRT}. These guidelines will be subject to future refinement when the clinical experience in head-and-neck {IMRT} advances.},

	abstract = {It would seem logical that patients with nodal metastases low in the neck would fare less well than patients with disease high in the neck. The penultimate {UICC} classification suggested that neck node level was important although there was no mention of this in the most recent classification. In addition, patients with carcinomas at the various sites would be expected to have different patterns of nodal involvement. Of 3419 patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma on the Liverpool University Head and Neck Unit database, 947 had neck node metastases. The neck node levels were coded as (I)sub-mandibular, ({II}) above the thyroid notch, ({III}) below the thyroid notch and ({IV}) supra-clavicular/posterior triangle nodes. Levels {II} and {III} contained the deep jugular chain. The relationship between node level and site and sub-site and survival were analysed with particular emphasis on multivariate methods. The 5-year survival for the whole group was 51\% and survival fell with decreasing node level (I-{IV}) being 37\% for sub-mandibular nodes, 32\% for deep cervical nodes and 25\% for lower deep cervical nodes. The 18-month survival for supra-clavicular and posterior triangle nodes was 21\%. The difference in survival was significant (x23= 24.42, P {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that as the level of the nodes fell from the sub-mandibular refion to the supra-clavicular region the prognosis worsened (estimate = -0.3378, P = 0.0003). Level {II} (upper deep cervical) nodes were the most commonly involved with regards to all primary sites and formed 69\% of all neck node metastases. Over three quarters of laryngeal oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal metastases went ot this level whereas only 47\% of oral cancers did. Most of the remainder of these latter lesions metastasized to level I (42\%). These findings were confirmed by multiple logistic regression. When studying survival for lymph node level with regard to site all sites had a reducing prognosis with decrasing node level except for larynx. Multiple linear regression showed an association between decreasing node level and increasing N-stage (P = 0.001) with increasing T-stage (P = 0.0014) and as the site moved from the mouth to the larynx (P = 0.0047). The present data support the view that neck node level is important as regards prognosis for most sites in the head and neck. The data confirm the clinical view that deep cervical nodes are most frequently affected by head and neck cancer with level {IV} nodes being unusual and clinically tending to herald a non head and neck tumour and that level {III} nodes are relatively uncommon. This is surprising as one would expect at least a proportion of laryngeal carcinomas and quite a high proportion of lhypopharyngeal carcinomas to metastasize to this region.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the incidence, distribution, and spread pattern of retropharyngeal lymph node ({RLN}) involvement in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ({NPC}) by using magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}).
Methods and Materials: The {MR} images of 275 patients with newly diagnosed {NPC} were reviewed retrospectively. Nodes were classiﬁed as metastatic based on size criteria, the presence of nodal necrosis, and extracapsular spread.
Results: Retropharyngeal lymph node involvement was detected in 175 (63.6\%) patients. Metastatic {RLNs} were seen at the following levels: occipital bone, 24 (9.6\%) nodes; C1, 157 (62.5\%) nodes; C1/2, 40 (15.9\%) nodes; C2, 27 (10.8\%) nodes; C2/3, 1 (0.4\%) node; and C3, 2 (0.8\%) nodes. The incidence of {RLN} involvement was equal to the incidence of cervical lymph node involvement (81.4\% vs. 81.4\%) in 215 patients with nodal metastases. A signiﬁcantly higher incidence of metastatic {RLNs} was observed in the presence of oropharynx, prestyloid parapharyngeal space, post-styloid parapharyngeal space, longus colli muscle, medial pterygoid muscle, levator muscle of velum palatini, tensor muscle of velum palatini, Level {II} node, Level {III} node, and Level V node involvement. A signiﬁcantly lower incidence of metastatic {RLNs} was found in T1, N0, and Stage I disease. Conversely, no signiﬁcant difference in the incidence of metastatic {RLNs} was observed between T1, 2, and, 3; N2 and N3; or Stage {II}, {III}, and {IV} disease.
Conclusions: There is an orderly decrease in the incidence of metastatic lateral {RLNs} from the C1 to C3 level. Metastatic {RLNs} associate well with involvement of certain structures in early stage primary tumors and lymph node metastases of the upper jugular chain (Level {II}, Level {III} nodes) and the posterior triangle (Level V nodes). Both {RLNs} and cervical Level {II} nodes appear to be the ﬁrst-echelon nodes in {NPC}. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Context
Management of newly diagnosed prostate cancer ({PCa}) is guided in part by accurate clinical staging. The role of imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography ({PET}/{CT}), in initial staging remains controversial.
Objective
To systematically review the studies of {MRI} and/or {PET}/{CT} in the staging of newly diagnosed {PCa} with respect to tumor (T), nodal (N), and metastatic (M) staging ({TNM} staging).
Evidence acquisition
We performed a systematic review of the literature using {MEDLINE} and Web of Science databases between 2012 and 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses ({PRISMA}) statement guidelines.
Evidence synthesis
A total of 139 studies (83 on T, 47 on N, and 24 on M status) were included. Ninety-nine (71\%) were retrospective, 39 (28\%) were prospective, and one was a randomized controlled trial ({RCT}). Most studies on T staging examined {MRI}, while {PET}/{CT} was used primarily for N and M staging. Sensitivity for the detection of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymph node invasion ranged widely. When imaging was incorporated into existing risk tools, gain in accuracy was observed in some studies, although these findings have not been replicated. For M staging, most favorable results were reported for prostate-specific membrane antigen ({PSMA}) {PET}/{CT}, which demonstrated significantly better performance than conventional imaging.
Conclusions
A variety of studies on modern imaging techniques for {TNM} staging in newly diagnosed {PCa} exist. For T and N staging, reported sensitivity of imaging modalities such as {MRI} or {PET}/{CT} varied widely due to data heterogeneity, small sample size, and low event rates resulting in large confidence intervals and a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, uniformity in data presentation and standardization on this topic are needed. The most promising technique for M staging, which was evaluated recently in an {RCT}, is {PSMA}-{PET}/{CT}.
Patient summary
We performed a systematic review of currently available imaging modalities to stage newly diagnosed prostate cancer. With respect to local tumor and lymph node assessment, performance of imaging ranged widely. However, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed favorable results for the detection of distant metastases.},

This makes magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. In particular, {MRI} is indispensable for the decision to refrain from neoadjuvant therapy and to choose a primary surgical approach. In addition to the oncologically generally relevant T-, N-, and M-criteria, two further parameters are included: the extramural vascular infiltration and the circumferential resection margin. Due to the significant impact of {MRI} on further therapeutic decision-making, standardized {MR} image quality is considered essential. Key Points:   Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. Critical anatomic landmarks for evaluation are circumferential resection margins.

	abstract = {Author summary The majority of cancer related deaths are due to the development of secondary tumors called metastases. However, the dynamics of metastases establishment and growth and their relation with the primary tumor evolution are still not clear. A standard treatment starts with the resection of the primary tumor. At this time metastases may have already formed and still be too small to be detected. The presence of only undetectable metastases poses a challenge for deciding on the follow-up therapy. These small metastases could grow to a detectable size—thus leading to a recurrence of the disease—some time after surgery. We are interested in this time until cancer relapse. We present a mathematical model of metastases formation using tools from probability theory and estimate the model parameters for five different cancer types. Our predictions for the probability of visible metastases present at surgery and the mean time to relapse when no visible metastases are found at surgery are both in agreement with clinical data.},

If performed prior to biopsy or other surgical intervention, {FDG}-{PET}/{CT} has high sensitivity for the detection of the primary site in patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary origin and can be used to direct the surgical workup. {FDG}-{PET}/{CT} is superior to {CT} alone for detection of nodal metastases outside the expected pattern or distant metastases or second primary cancers and can greatly affect determination of appropriate management including surgical eligibility. Prior to the advent of {PET}/{CT}, many patients undergoing (chemo)radiation-based therapy had planned post-treatment neck dissection; {FDG}-{PET}/{CT} now has a proven role in the evaluation of recurrent or persistent disease amenable to salvage surgery and enables safe avoidance of planned postradiation neck dissection with a high negative predictive value. Specifically for this important application, two standardized reporting metrics may be used in the head and neck anatomic region: the “Hopkins criteria” and the “Neck Imaging Reporting and Data System”; both systems produce a formalized evaluation and recommendation based on {PET}/{CT} findings. The role of {PET}/{CT} as a replacement for elective neck dissection or examination under anesthesia remains controversial but deserves further study. {FDG}-{PET}/{CT} has a wide-ranging impact on the surgical management of patients with {HNSCC} and should be used routinely in patients with unknown primary nodal disease and those presenting with advanced-stage cancers at initial staging and to assess treatment response.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
Multimodality imaging including 18F-{FDG}-{PET} has improved the detection threshold of nodal metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}). The aim of this retrospective analysis is to investigate the impact of {FDG}-{PET}/{CT}-based nodal target volume definition ({FDG}-{PET}/{CT}-based {NTV}) on radiotherapy outcomes, compared to conventional {CT}-based nodal target volume definition ({CT}-based {NTV}).
Materials and methods
Six-hundred-thirty-three patients treated for {HNSCC} with definitive (chemo)radiotherapy using {IMRT}/{VMAT} techniques between 2008 and 2017 were analyzed. {FDG}-{PET}/{CT}-based {NTV} was performed in 46\% of the patients. The median follow-up was 31 months. Diagnostic imaging depicting the regional recurrence was co-registered with the initial {CT}-scan to reconstruct the exact site of the recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with radiotherapy outcome.
Results
{FDG}-{PET}/{CT}-based {NTV} improved control of disease in the {CTVelective}-nodal ({HR}: 0.33, p = 0.026), overall regional control ({HR}: 0.62, p = 0.027) and overall survival ({HR}: 0.71, p = 0.033) compared to {CT}-based {NTV}. The risk for recurrence in the {CTVelective}-nodal was increased in case of synchronous local recurrence of the primary tumor ({HR}: 12.4, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion
{FDG}-{PET}/{CT}-based {NTV} significantly improved control of disease in the {CTVelective}-nodal, overall regional control and overall survival compared to {CT}-based {NTV}. A significant proportion of {CTVelective}-nodal recurrences are potentially new nodal manifestations from a synchronous local recurrent primary tumor. These results support the concept of target volume transformation and give an indication of the potential of {FDG}-{PET} to guide gradual radiotherapy dose de-escalation in elective neck treatment in {HNSCC}.},

To eliminate potential misinterpretation, overlap, and lack of standardization, the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, with input from the Education Committee of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery, has developed a classification system for these procedures. This has now been adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. The classification is based on the following concepts: (1) radical neck dissection is the fundamental procedure with which all other neck dissections are compared, (2) modified radical neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structure(s), (3) selective neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more group(s) of lymph nodes, and (4) extended radical neck dissection denotes removal of one or more additional lymphatic and/or nonlymphatic structure(s). Adherence to the principles of this classification system to describe neck dissection techniques should provide an improved method of communication. Furthermore, the system provides a rational framework on which subsequent terminology can be added.(Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1991;117:601-605)},

	abstract = {Many tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) spread along the lymphatic network. Current imaging modalities can only detect sufficiently large metastases. Therefore, adjacent lymph node levels ({LNL}) are irradiated electively since they may harbor microscopic tumors. We apply Bayesian Networks ({BN}) to model lymphatic tumor progression. The model can subsequently be used to personalize the risk estimation of microscopic lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed patients based on their distribution of macroscopic metastases. A {BN} is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution. We represent {LNLs} by binary random variables corresponding to the {BN} nodes. Each {LNL} is associated with a hidden microscopic state and an observed macroscopic state (e.g. 18F-{FDG}-{PET}/{CT} imaging). The primary tumor is represented by network input nodes. We demonstrate the concept for early T-stage oropharyngeal carcinomas and their spread to ipsilateral lymph node levels ({LNL}) Ib to {IV}. We show that the {BN} parameters can be efficiently learnt by merging pathology findings on microscopic tumor progression (which is limited to a few published studies) and imaging data on macroscopic tumor progression such as {CT} and 18F-{FDG}-{PET} (which are widely available in clinical practice). The trained network can be used to quantify how the distribution of macroscopic metastases impacts the probability of microscopic involvement of the remaining {LNLs}. The analysis suggests that the risk of microscopic involvement of level {IV} exceeds 5\% only if level {III} harbors metastases. Excluding level {IV} from the elective {CTV} for other patients would reduce the integral dose delivered to the patient and potentially reduce acute and late side effects.},

Randomization was 1:1 to {PORT} (68 Gy/25\# to prostate) or whole-pelvic radiotherapy ({WPRT}, 68 Gy/25\# to prostate, 50 Gy/25\# to pelvic nodes, including common iliac) using computerized stratified block randomization, stratified by Gleason score, type of androgen deprivation, prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, and prior transurethral resection of the prostate. All patients received image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and minimum 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary end point was 5-year biochemical failure-free survival ({BFFS}), and secondary end points were disease-free survival ({DFS}) and overall survival ({OS}).{RESULTSFrom} November 2011 to August 2017, a total of 224 patients were randomly assigned ({PORT} = 114, {WPRT} = 110). At a median follow-up of 68 months, 36 biochemical failures ({PORT} = 25, {WPRT} = 7) and 24 deaths ({PORT} = 13, {WPRT} = 11) were recorded. Five-year {BFFS} was 95.0\% (95\% {CI}, 88.4 to 97.9) with {WPRT} versus 81.2\% (95\% {CI}, 71.6 to 87.8) with {PORT}, with an unadjusted hazard ratio ({HR}) of 0.23 (95\% {CI}, 0.10 to 0.52; P {\textless} .0001). {WPRT} also showed higher 5-year {DFS} (89.5\% v 77.2\%; {HR}, 0.40; 95\% {CI}, 0.22 to 0.73; P = .002), but 5-year {OS} did not appear to differ (92.5\% v 90.8\%; {HR}, 0.92; 95\% {CI}, 0.41 to 2.05; P = .83). Distant metastasis-free survival was also higher with {WPRT} (95.9\% v 89.2\%; {HR}, 0.35; 95\% {CI}, 0.15 to 0.82; P = .01). Benefit in {BFFS} and {DFS} was maintained across prognostic subgroups.{CONCLUSIONProphylactic} pelvic irradiation for high-risk, locally advanced prostate cancer improved {BFFS} and {DFS} as compared with {PORT}, but {OS} did not appear to differ.},

The application-specific cost is minimized subject to a constraint on the randomness of the solution, which is gradually lowered. We emphasize the intuition gained from analogy to statistical physics. Alternatively the method is derived within rate-distortion theory, where the annealing process is equivalent to computation of Shannon's rate-distortion function, and the annealing temperature is inversely proportional to the slope of the curve. The basic algorithm is extended by incorporating structural constraints to allow optimization of numerous popular structures including vector quantizers, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, radial basis functions, and mixtures of experts.},

We therefore assessed the outcomes of each treatment strategy using the National Cancer Database ({NCDB}).
Methods: The {NCDB} was used to identify patients diagnosed with {cT}1 N2a-2b or {cT}2 N1-2b {HPV}-A {OPC} from 2010 to 2013 who underwent treatment with primary surgery or {CRT}. Demographic and clinicopathologic predictors of treatment were analyzed by the chi-square test and logistic regression. Overall survival ({OS}) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and propensity score-matched analysis.
Results: We identiﬁed 3063 patients; 1576 (51.5\%) received {CRT} and 1487 (48.5\%) underwent primary surgery. Median follow up was 32 months. 972 (65.4\%) surgical patients received adjuvant {CRT}. On multivariable Cox regression, 3-year {OS} was comparable between surgery and {CRT} (hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.08, 95\% conﬁdence interval [{CI}] 0.83–1.41, P = 0.58). Inferior {OS} was signiﬁcantly associated with increasing clinical T and N stage, older age, and non-private insurance. Propensity score-matching yielded a 2526 patient cohort and redemonstrated similar {OS} ({HR}, 1.09; 95\% {CI} 0.81–1.47; P = 0.55). Comparable outcomes persisted in a subset analysis of patients with margin-negative resection, with 3-year {OS} 90.8\% in {CRT} patients vs. 93.6\% in surgery patients (log-rank P = 0.27).
Conclusions: Upfront surgery and {CRT} yielded comparable 3-year {OS} outcomes in this cohort. In this national sample, 65.4\% of surgical patients received trimodal therapy with adjuvant {CRT}, highlighting the need for improved patient selection for primary surgery.},

Even with recent advances, there are urgent needs for novel therapies to improve overall survival and decrease toxicities in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}). This article reviews historical data to provide a context and highlights recent data in understanding of epidemiology and pathophysiology and supporting changes in treatments of {HNSCC}, particularly in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. For use of immune checkpoint modulators such as programmed cell death protein 1 ({PD}-1) inhibitors, potential predictive biomarkers of clinical benefits are also summarized. In addition, this article reviews currently ongoing clinical trials and provides a perspective on future research directions.

Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) is the most common cancer arising in the head and neck region. The most common risk factors are smoking, excessive drinking, and human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection. While the overall incidence of smoking is decreasing, the incidence of {HPV}-related {HNSCC} is increasing in the United States and Western Europe, which led to a shift in understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis of this disease. The outcomes for non-metastatic {HNSCC} remains very encouraging and continues to improve. Advances in radiation technology and techniques, better organ preserving surgical options, and multidisciplinary treatment modalities have improved cure rates for locally advanced {HNSCC} patients. The treatment of metastatic disease, however, remains an area of need. The advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors has provided significantly better outcomes, but only a small proportion of patients obtain benefits. Most recurrent and/or metastatic {HNSCC} patients continue to have poor survival. This has led to the vigorous investigation of new biomarkers and biomarker-based therapies. Novel therapeutic options including adaptive cellular therapy and therapeutic vaccines are also on the horizon. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in the field of {HNSCC} and the future direction of research.},

This work uses a data-driven approach to compare different choices of edges in the graph of the model. The logarithm of the marginal likelihood and the associated Bayes factor are adopted as the means for this comparison.
In addition, the probability of metastases in different {LNLs} according to the {HMM} graph is compared with the prevalence in the data set. This is to further investigate the importance of individual connections.
The results indicate that the anatomically motivated graph describes the data comparatively well due to the important connection between {LNL} {II} and I. Further improvement is suggested by introducing a link between {LNL} {III} and V.},

	abstract = {In the 20+ years of Doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovered a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet–planet interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance ({MMR}). An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further computational difﬁculties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter space (∼7 × number of planets) that can have complex parameter correlations, particularly for systems near a {MMR}. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential evolution {MCMC} ({DEMCMC}) algorithm applied to radial velocity data while incorporating self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body {DEMCMC} ({RUN} {DMC}) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of the traditional {MCMC} by using an ensemble of Markov chains to adaptively improve the proposal distribution. {RUN} {DMC} can sample more efﬁciently from high-dimensional parameter spaces that have strong correlations between model parameters. We describe the methodology behind the algorithm, along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We ﬁnd that most algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However, the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to the details of individual planetary systems (e.g., number of planets, number of observations, orbital periods, and signal-to-noise of each planet), we offer recommendations for choosing the {DEMCMC} algorithm’s algorithmic parameters that result in excellent performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {Computing (ratios of) normalizing constants of probability models is a fundamental computational problem for many statistical and scientific studies. Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through establishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single "bridge" density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a "path"). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open problems.},

	abstract = {In generative modeling of neuroimaging data, such as dynamic causal modeling ({DCM}), one typically considers several alternative models, either to determine the most plausible explanation for observed data (Bayesian model selection) or to account for model uncertainty (Bayesian model averaging). Both procedures rest on estimates of the model evidence, a principled trade-off between model accuracy and complexity. In the context of {DCM}, the log evidence is usually approximated using variational Bayes. Although this approach is highly efﬁcient, it makes distributional assumptions and is vulnerable to local extrema. This paper introduces the use of thermodynamic integration ({TI}) for Bayesian model selection and averaging in the context of {DCM}. {TI} is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling which is asymptotically exact but orders of magnitude slower than variational Bayes. In this paper, we explain the theoretical foundations of {TI}, covering key concepts such as the free energy and its origins in statistical physics. Our aim is to convey an in-depth understanding of the method starting from its historical origin in statistical physics. In addition, we demonstrate the practical application of {TI} via a series of examples which serve to guide the user in applying this method. Furthermore, these examples demonstrate that, given an efﬁcient implementation and hardware capable of parallel processing, the challenge of high computational demand can be overcome successfully. The {TI} implementation presented in this paper is freely available as part of the open source software {TAPAS}.},

	abstract = {We propose a framework for general Bayesian inference. We argue that a valid update of a prior belief distribution to a posterior can be made for parameters which are connected to observations through a loss function rather than the traditional likelihood function, which is recovered as a special case. Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a true likelihood is known yet provides coherent subjective inference in much more general settings.

	abstract = {In Bayesian statistics, the marginal likelihood, also known as the evidence, is used to evaluate model fit as it quantifies the joint probability of the data under the prior. In contrast, non-Bayesian models are typically compared using cross-validation on held-out data, either through \$k\$-fold partitioning or leave-\$p\$-out subsampling. We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-\$p\$-out cross-validation averaged over all values of \$p\$ and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability. This offers new insight into the marginal likelihood and cross-validation and highlights the potential sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the choice of the prior. We suggest an alternative approach using cumulative cross-validation following a preparatory training phase. Our work has connections to prequential analysis and intrinsic Bayes factors but is motivated through a different course.},

Adaptive fractionation accounts for variations of configurations between {OAR} and the tumor. In part I of this series, the adaptation minimizes the {OAR} (physical) dose and maintains the total tumor (physical) dose. In this work, instead, the adaptation is based on the biological effective dose ({BED}). Unlike the linear programming approach in part I, we build a fraction size lookup table using mathematical induction. The lookup table essentially describes the fraction size as a function of the remaining tumor {BED}, the {OAR}/tumor dose ratio and the remaining number of fractions. The lookup table is calculated by maximizing the expected survival of {OAR} and preserving the tumor cell kill. Immediately before the treatment of each fraction, the {OAR}-tumor configuration and thus the dose ratio can be obtained from the daily setup image, and then the fraction size can be determined by the lookup table.

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is fractionized to increase the therapeutic ratio. Fractionation in conventional treatment is determined as part of the prescription, and a fixed fraction size is used for the whole course of treatment. Due to patients' day-to-day variations on the relative distance between the tumor and the organs at risk ({OAR}), a better therapeutic ratio may be attained by using an adaptive fraction size. Intuitively, we want to use a larger fraction size when {OAR} and the tumor are far apart and a smaller fraction size when {OAR} and the tumor are close to each other. The concept and strategies of adaptive fractionation therapy ({AFT}) are introduced in this paper. {AFT} is an on-line adaptive technique that utilizes the variations of internal structures to get optimal {OAR} sparing. Changes of internal structures are classified as different configurations according to their feasibility to the radiation delivery. A priori knowledge is used to describe the probability distribution of these configurations. On-line processes include identifying the configuration via daily image guidance and optimizing the current fraction size. The optimization is modeled as a dynamic linear programming problem so that at the end of the treatment course, the tumor receives the same planned dose while {OAR} receives less dose than the regular fractionation delivery. Extensive simulations, which include thousands of treatment courses with each course consisting of 40 fractions, are used to test the efficiency and robustness of the presented technique. The gains of {OAR} sparing depend on the variations on configurations and the bounds of the fraction size. The larger the variations and the looser the bounds are, the larger the gains will be. Compared to the conventional fractionation technique with 2 Gy/fraction in 40 fractions, for a 20\% variation on tumor–{OAR} configurations and [1 Gy, 3 Gy] fraction size bounds, the cumulative {OAR} dose with adaptive fractionation is 3–8 Gy, or 7–20\% less than that of the regular fractionation, while maintaining the same cumulative tumor dose as prescribed.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

The volume treated with postoperative radiation therapy ({PORT}) is a mediator of toxicity, and reduced volumes result in improved quality of life ({QOL}). In this phase {II} trial, treatment volumes were reduced by omitting {PORT} to the pathologically negative ({PN}0) neck in patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

{METHODS}

Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who underwent surgical resection and neck dissection with a {PN}0 neck and high-risk features mandating {PORT} to the primary and/or involved neck were eligible. The primary end point was greater than 90\% disease control in the unirradiated neck. {QOL} was evaluated using the {MD} Anderson Dysphagia Inventory and the University of Michigan patient-reported xerostomia questionnaire.

{RESULTS}

Seventy-three patients were enrolled, and 72 were evaluable. Median age was 56 years (range, 31 to 81 years); 58 patients were male, and 47 (65\%) had a smoking history. Sites included oral cavity (n = 14), oropharynx (n = 37), hypopharynx (n = 4), larynx (n = 16), and unknown primary tumor (n = 1). According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual (7th edition), 67 patients (93\%) had stage {III}/{IV} disease, and 71\% of tumors involved or crossed midline. No patient had contralateral neck {PORT}. In 17 patients (24\%), only the primary site was treated. At a median follow-up of 53 months, two patients experienced treatment failure of the {PN}0 unirradiated neck; they also experienced treatment failure locally. Unirradiated neck control was 97\% (95\% {CI}, 93.4\% to 100.0\%). Five-year rates of local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 84\%, 93\%, 60\%, and 64\%, respectively. {QOL} measures were not significantly different from baseline at 12 and 24 months post-{PORT} (P {\textgreater} .05).

{CONCLUSION}

Eliminating {PORT} to the {PN}0 neck resulted in excellent control rates in the unirradiated neck without long-term adverse effects on global {QOL}.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To assess, through a retrospective review, clinical outcomes of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with unilateral radiotherapy techniques that irradiate the involved tonsil region and ipsilateral neck only.
{METHODS} {AND} {MATERIALS}: Of 901 patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil treated with radiotherapy at our institution, we identified 102 that were treated using unilateral radiotherapy techniques. All patients had their primary site of disease restricted to the tonsillar fossa or anterior pillar, with {\textless}1 cm involvement of the soft palate. Patients had {TX} (n = 17 patients), T1 (n = 52), or T2 (n = 33) disease, with Nx (n = 3), N0 (n = 33), N1 (n = 23), N2a (n = 21), or N2b (n = 22) neck disease.
{RESULTS}: Sixty-one patients (60\%) underwent diagnostic tonsillectomy before radiotherapy. Twenty-seven patients (26\%) underwent excision of a cervical lymph node or neck dissection before radiotherapy. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months. Locoregional control at the primary site and ipsilateral neck was 100\%. Two patients experienced contralateral nodal recurrence (2\%). The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 95\% and 96\%, respectively. The 5-year freedom from contralateral nodal recurrence rate was 96\%. Nine patients required feeding tubes during therapy. Of the 2 patients with contralateral recurrence, 1 experienced an isolated neck recurrence and was salvaged with contralateral neck dissection only and remains alive and free of disease. The other patient presented with a contralateral base of tongue tumor and involved cervical lymph node, which may have represented a second primary tumor, and died of disease.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Unilateral radiotherapy for patients with {TX}-T2, N0-N2b primary tonsil carcinoma results in high rates of disease control, with low rates of contralateral nodal failure and a low incidence of acute toxicity requiring gastrostomy.},

	abstract = {Background
The head and neck region has rich regional lymphatic network, with a theoretical risk on contralateral metastasis from oropharyngeal cancer ({OPC}). There is a long-standing convention to irradiate the great majority of these tumors electively to both sides of the neck to reduce the risk of contralateral regional failure ({cRF}), but this can induce significant toxicity. We aimed to identify patient groups where elective contralateral irradiation may safely be omitted.
Methods
{PubMed} and {EMBASE} were searched for original full-text articles in English with a combination of search terms related to the end points: {cRF} in {OPC} primarily treated by radiotherapy only to the ipsilateral neck and identifying predictive factors for increased incidence of {cRF}. The data from the identified studies were pooled, the incidence of {cRF} was calculated and the correlation with different predictive factors was investigated.
Results
Eleven full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, 1116 patients were treated to the ipsilateral neck alone. The mean incidence of {cRF} was 2.42\% (range 0–5.9\%, 95\% {CI} 1.6–3.5\%). The incidence of {cRF} correlated only with T-stage (p=0.008), and involvement of midline (p=0.001). However, the significant correlation with T-stage can be explained by the very low incidence of {cRF} among T1 (0.77\%), and disappeared when the incidence of {cRF} was compared between T2, T3,and T4 (p=0.344).
Conclusion
The incidence of {cRF} in patients with {OPC} is very low, with involvement of midline providing the most significant prognosticator. These results call for trials on unilateral elective irradiation in selected groups.},

Background: Treatment for {HPV} positive(+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ({OSCC}) is highly effective but associated with significant short and long term treatment related morbidity. We hypothesize that decreasing the regions of elective nodal irradiation ({ENI}) in the neck will lead to less toxicity and better quality of life/functional outcomes while maintaining high disease control rates in patients with favourable prognosis {HPV}+ {OSCC}. Methods: {HN}.10 is a Canadian Cancer Trials Group phase {II} trial with a primary objective to evaluate the efficacy of primary definitive radiotherapy ({RT}) or chemoradiotherapy ({CRT}) utilizing volume reduced {ENI} as measured by 2-year event-free survival ({EFS}) in patients with low-risk {HPV}+ {OPSCC}. Secondary objectives include to evaluate overall survival, local control, regional control, locoregional control, out-of-field regional control, distant metastasis free survival, early and late toxicities of treatment, subjective swallowing functions, quality of life, utilization of healthcare resources, work productivity, and prognostic biomarkers. An imaging and biospecimen bank will be compiled as part of trial conduct. Key eligibility criteria include: pathologically proven diagnosis of {HPV}+ {OPSCC}; {HPV} association determined locally by either p16 immunohistochemistry or direct detection of {HPV} {DNA} sequences (e.g. by {PCR} or in situ hybridization) performed on a core needle or surgical biopsy specimen of the primary tumour or involved cervical lymph node; clinical stage T1-3 N0-1 M0 ({UICC}/{AJCC} 8th Ed.); fit for radiotherapy +/-chemoradiotherapy. Statistical Design: The primary endpoint is 2-year {EFS}. Assuming 2-year {EFS} to be 91\% (Ha) for low-risk {HPV}-related {OPSCC} with standard treatment, and that the experimental treatment will be considered as ineffective if the 2-year {EFS} is ≤ 85\% (H0), with one-sided alpha of 0.1, a sample size of 100 patients will have 80\% power to detect a 6\% difference of 2-year {EFS}. With 3 years of accrual and 2 years of follow-up, the total duration of this study will be 5 years. A total of 304.7 person-years of follow-up is needed for the final analysis. The null hypothesis (H0) will be rejected when the observed survival rate is 88.85\% or higher (i.e. if there are 18 or fewer {EFS} events observed).

Precise diagnostic assessment of tumour extension in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) is of critical importance for ensuring that patients receive proper treatment. Preliminary studies have shown divergent results of {PET}/{CT} in diagnosis and staging of {HNSCC}. The aims of this study were (1) to systematically review and meta-analyse published data about the diagnostic accuracy of {PET}/{CT} for diagnosing patients with {HNSCC} and (2) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of {PET}/{CT} with that of standard conventional imaging ({SCI}).
Methods
A systematic literature search in the {PubMed}, Embase and Cochrane databases on publications of {PET}/{CT} diagnostics of {HNSCC} from January 2005 to July 2013 was carried out. All retrieved studies were reviewed and qualitatively analysed. Along with the calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity of {PET}/{CT} and {SCI}, bubble- and summary receiver operating characteristics ({SROC}) plots were created.
Findings
Two meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy were conducted. The first, on {PET}/{CT}, included 987 patients distributed across nine studies. The second, on {SCI}, included 517 patients participating in a total of six studies among those comparing {PET}/{CT} to {SCI}. The meta-analyses showed a pooled sensitivity of 89.3\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI}]: 83.4–93.2\%) and specificity of 89.5\% (95\% {CI}: 82.9–93.7\%) for {PET}/{CT} and correspondingly, a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 71.6\% (95\% {CI}: 44.3–88.9\%) and 78.0\% (95\%{CI}: 30.2–96.7\%) for {SCI}. A graphical comparison to {SCI} showed a clear difference in favour of {PET}/{CT}.
Interpretation
{PET}/{CT} is highly accurate in diagnosing patients suffering from {HNSCC}},

	abstract = {The definition of tumor involved volumes in patients with head and neck cancer poses great challenges with the increasing use of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques eg, volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity modulated proton therapy. The risk of underdosing the tumor might increase unless great care is taken in the process. The information gained from imaging is increasing with both {PET} and {MRI} becoming readily available for the definition of targets. The information gained from these techniques is indeed multidimensional as one often acquire data on eg, metabolism, diffusion, and hypoxia together with anatomical and structural information. Nevertheless, much work remains to fully exploit the available information on a patient-specific level. Multimodality target definition in radiotherapy is a chain of processes that must be individually scrutinized, optimized and quality assured. Any uncertainties or errors in image acquisition, reconstruction, interpretation, and delineation are systematic errors and hence will potentially have a detrimental effect on the entire radiotherapy treatment and hence; the chance of cure or the risk of unnecessary side effects. Common guidelines and procedures create a common minimum standard and ground for evaluation and development. In Denmark, the treatment of head and neck cancer is organized within the multidisciplinary Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group ({DAHANCA}). The radiotherapy quality assurance group of {DAHANCA} organized a workshop in January 2020 with participants from oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine from all centers in Denmark, treating patients with head and neck cancer. The participants agreed on a national guideline on imaging for target delineation in head and neck cancer radiotherapy, which has been approved by the {DAHANCA} group. The guidelines are available in the Supplementary. The use of multimodality imaging is being recommended for the planning of all radical treatments with a macroscopic tumor. 2-[18F]{FDG}-{PET}/{CT} should be available, preferable in the treatment position. The recommended {MRI} sequences are T1, T2 with and without fat suppression, and T1 with contrast enhancement, preferable in the treatment position. The interpretation of clinical information, including thorough physical examination as well as imaging, should be done in a multidisciplinary setting with an oncologist, radiologist, and nuclear medicine specialist.},

	abstract = {The usefulness of {PET}/{MRI} in head and neck malignancy has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and confidence of {PET}/{MRI} in comparison with {PET} or {MRI} alone. This study included 73 consecutive patients who underwent [18F] {FDG} {PET}/{MRI} in head and neck under the suspicion of malignancy. A neuroradiologist and a nuclear medicine specialist reviewed {MRI} and {PET} images, respectively and independently, followed by a consensus review of {PET}/{MRI} one month later. For 134 lesions, accuracy and confidence were compared among {PET}, {MRI}, and {PET}/{MRI}. For lesion base, {PET}/{MRI} had a sensitivity of 85.7\%, a specificity of 89.1\%, a {PPV} of 89.6\%, a negative predictive value of 85.1\%, and an accuracy of 87.3\%. {AUCs} of {PET}/{MRI} per lesion (0.926) and per patient (0.934) for diagnosing malignancy were higher than {PET} (0.847 and 0.747, respectively) or {MRI} (0.836 and 0.798, respectively) alone (P {\textless} 0.05). More than 80\% of the cases (111/134) showed diagnostic concordance between {PET} and {MRI}. {PPV} of {PET}/{MRI} was higher in malignant concordant cases (93.2\%, 55/59) than in discordant cases (62.5\%, 5/8) (p = 0.040). Confident scoring rate in malignant concordant cases was higher on {PET}/{MRI} (96.6\%, 57/59) than on {MRI} (76.3\%, 45/59) (p = 0.003). In conclusion, compared with {PET} or {MRI} alone, {PET}/{MRI} presents better diagnostic performance in accuracy and confidence for diagnosis of malignancy. {PET}/{MRI} is useful in patients with head and neck cancer.},

	abstract = {A major problem with silicon solar cells is that they lose efﬁciency with increased operating temperature, at a rate of about 0.5\% per 1◦C increase. This causes a signiﬁcant reduction in power output, particularly in hot climates. A solution in the form of an optical coating is presented, which reﬂects infrared ({IR}) radiation to limit the module temperature increase. The optical coating is also anti-reﬂecting ({AR}) in the visible wavelength range, increasing the amount of light reaching the cell absorber. Modelling results show that the weighted average reﬂection ({WAR}) is reduced to 1.22\% in the wavelength range associated with the band gap of silicon. The optical coating then reﬂects up to 70\% of the infra-red. Although the model presented is based on silicon, the coating design can be modiﬁed to work with other photovoltaic technologies. The coating design uses only 4 layers and can be deposited using conventional high throughput magnetron sputtering systems already familiar to glass manufacturers. Preliminary work on optimising the coating deposition parameters is also presented here alongside modelling results. Deployment of the infra-red reﬂecting optical coating on solar cover glass represents a potential breakthrough in solar technology and will result in a signiﬁcant increase in the power output of photovoltaic modules.},

	title = {Distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo},
	abstract = {We consider the design of Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods for large-scale, distributed, heterogeneous compute facilities, with a focus on synthesising sample sets across multiple runs performed in parallel. While theory suggests that many independent Markov chains may be run and their samples pooled, the well-known practical problem of quasi-ergodicity, or poor mixing, frustrates this otherwise simple approach. Furthermore, without some mechanism for hastening the convergence of individual chains, overall speedup from parallelism is limited by the portion of each chain to be discarded as burn-in. Existing multiple-chain methods, such as parallel tempering and population {MCMC}, use a synchronous exchange of samples to expedite convergence. This work instead proposes mixing in an additional independent proposal, representing some hitherto best estimate or summary of the posterior, and cooperatively adapting this across chains. Such adaptation can be asynchronous, increases the ensemble’s robustness to quasi-ergodic behaviour in constituent chains, and may improve overall tolerance to fault.},

	abstract = {Most head and neck cancers are derived from the mucosal epithelium in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx and are known collectively as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}). Oral cavity and larynx cancers are generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse or both, whereas pharynx cancers are increasingly attributed to infection with human papillomavirus ({HPV}), primarily {HPV}-16. Thus, {HNSCC} can be separated into {HPV}-negative or {HPV}-positive {HNSCC}. Despite evidence of histological progression from cellular atypia through various degrees of dysplasia, ultimately leading to invasive {HNSCC}, most patients are diagnosed with late-stage {HNSCC} without a clinically evident antecedent premalignant lesion. Traditional staging of {HNSCC} using the tumour-node-metastasis system has been supplemented by the 2017 {AJCC}/{UICC} staging system, which incorporated additional information relevant to {HPV}-positive disease. The treatment approach is generally multimodal, consisting of surgery followed by chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation or {CRT}) for oral cavity cancers and primary {CRT} for pharynx and larynx cancers. The {EGFR} monoclonal antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in {HPV}-negative {HNSCC} where co-morbidities prevent the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The {FDA} approved the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treatment of recurrent or metastatic {HNSCC} and pembrolizumab as primary treatment for unresectable disease. Elucidation of the molecular genetic landscape of {HNSCC} over the past decade has revealed new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Ongoing efforts aim to integrate our understanding of {HNSCC} biology and immunobiology to identify predictive biomarkers that will enable delivery of the most effective, least toxic therapies.},

	abstract = {This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the {GLOBOCAN} 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts. {CA}: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians 2018;0:1-31. © 2018 American Cancer Society},
