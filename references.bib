	abstract = {In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines for the delineation of the neck node levels in node negative patients (Radiother Oncol, 69: 227–36, 2003). In 2006, these guidelines were extended to include the characteristics of the node positive and the post-operative neck (Radiother Oncol, 79: 15–20, 2006). These guidelines did not fully address all nodal regions and some of the anatomic descriptions were ambiguous, thereby limiting consistent use of the recommendations. In this framework, a task force comprising opinion leaders in the field of head and neck radiation oncology from European, Asian, Australia/New Zealand and North American clinical research organizations was formed to review and update the previously published guidelines on nodal level delineation. Based on the nomenclature proposed by the American Head and Neck Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and in alignment with the TNM atlas for lymph nodes in the neck, 10 node groups (some being divided into several levels) were defined with a concise description of their main anatomic boundaries, the normal structures juxtaposed to these nodes, and the main tumor sites at risk for harboring metastases in those levels. Emphasis was placed on those levels not adequately considered previously (or not addressed at all); these included the lower neck (e.g. supraclavicular nodes), the scalp (e.g. retroauricular and occipital nodes), and the face (e.g. buccal and parotid nodes). Lastly, peculiarities pertaining to the node-positive and the post-operative clinical scenarios were also discussed. In conclusion, implementation of these guidelines in the daily practice of radiation oncology should contribute to the reduction of treatment variations from clinician to clinician and facilitate the conduct of multi-institutional clinical trials.},

However, the dynamics of metastases establishment and growth and their relation with the primary tumor evolution are still not clear. A standard treatment starts with the resection of the primary tumor. At this time metastases may have already formed and still be too small to be detected. The presence of only undetectable metastases poses a challenge for deciding on the follow-up therapy. These small metastases could grow to a detectable size—thus leading to a recurrence of the disease—some time after surgery. We are interested in this time until cancer relapse. We present a mathematical model of metastases formation using tools from probability theory and estimate the model parameters for five different cancer types. Our predictions for the probability of visible metastases present at surgery and the mean time to relapse when no visible metastases are found at surgery are both in agreement with clinical data.},

If performed prior to biopsy or other surgical intervention, FDG-PET/CT has high sensitivity for the detection of the primary site in patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary origin and can be used to direct the surgical workup. FDG-PET/CT is superior to CT alone for detection of nodal metastases outside the expected pattern or distant metastases or second primary cancers and can greatly affect determination of appropriate management including surgical eligibility. Prior to the advent of PET/CT, many patients undergoing (chemo)radiation-based therapy had planned post-treatment neck dissection; FDG-PET/CT now has a proven role in the evaluation of recurrent or persistent disease amenable to salvage surgery and enables safe avoidance of planned postradiation neck dissection with a high negative predictive value. Specifically for this important application, two standardized reporting metrics may be used in the head and neck anatomic region: the “Hopkins criteria” and the “Neck Imaging Reporting and Data System”; both systems produce a formalized evaluation and recommendation based on PET/CT findings. The role of PET/CT as a replacement for elective neck dissection or examination under anesthesia remains controversial but deserves further study. FDG-PET/CT has a wide-ranging impact on the surgical management of patients with HNSCC and should be used routinely in patients with unknown primary nodal disease and those presenting with advanced-stage cancers at initial staging and to assess treatment response.},

We hypothesize that PET/CT will accurately predict final pathologic AJCC 8th edition staging in patients with HPV+ OPSCC. Methods All patients with primary HPV+ OPSCC with preoperative PET/CT who underwent transoral robotic surgery and neck dissection between 2011 and 2017 were identified. Data were collected via chart review. Two neuroradiologists performed blinded re-evaluation of all scans. Primary tumor size and cervical nodal disease characteristics were recorded and TNM staging was extrapolated. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to assess interrater reliability. Test for symmetry was performed to analyze discordance between radiologic and pathologic staging. Results Forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Interrater reliability was substantial between radiologists for nodal (N) and overall staging (OS) (? = 0.715 and 0.715). Radiologist A review resulted in identical OS for 67\% of patients, overstaging for 31\%, and understaging for 2\%. Radiologist B review resulted in 61\% identical OS, 39\% overstaging, and 0\% understaging. In misclassified cases, the test of symmetry shows strong bias toward overstaging N stage and OS (P?},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
Multimodality imaging including 18F-FDG-PET has improved the detection threshold of nodal metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this retrospective analysis is to investigate the impact of FDG-PET/CT-based nodal target volume definition (FDG-PET/CT-based NTV) on radiotherapy outcomes, compared to conventional CT-based nodal target volume definition (CT-based NTV).
Materials and methods
Six-hundred-thirty-three patients treated for HNSCC with definitive (chemo)radiotherapy using IMRT/VMAT techniques between 2008 and 2017 were analyzed. FDG-PET/CT-based NTV was performed in 46\% of the patients. The median follow-up was 31 months. Diagnostic imaging depicting the regional recurrence was co-registered with the initial CT-scan to reconstruct the exact site of the recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with radiotherapy outcome.
Results
FDG-PET/CT-based NTV improved control of disease in the CTVelective-nodal (HR: 0.33, p = 0.026), overall regional control (HR: 0.62, p = 0.027) and overall survival (HR: 0.71, p = 0.033) compared to CT-based NTV. The risk for recurrence in the CTVelective-nodal was increased in case of synchronous local recurrence of the primary tumor (HR: 12.4, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion
FDG-PET/CT-based NTV significantly improved control of disease in the CTVelective-nodal, overall regional control and overall survival compared to CT-based NTV. A significant proportion of CTVelective-nodal recurrences are potentially new nodal manifestations from a synchronous local recurrent primary tumor. These results support the concept of target volume transformation and give an indication of the potential of FDG-PET to guide gradual radiotherapy dose de-escalation in elective neck treatment in HNSCC.},

This makes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. In particular, MRI is indispensable for the decision to refrain from neoadjuvant therapy and to choose a primary surgical approach. In addition to the oncologically generally relevant T-, N-, and M-criteria, two further parameters are included: the extramural vascular infiltration and the circumferential resection margin. Due to the significant impact of MRI on further therapeutic decision-making, standardized MR image quality is considered essential. Key Points:   Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. Critical anatomic landmarks for evaluation are circumferential resection margins.

	abstract = {Context
Management of newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa) is guided in part by accurate clinical staging. The role of imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), in initial staging remains controversial.
Objective
To systematically review the studies of MRI and/or PET/CT in the staging of newly diagnosed PCa with respect to tumor (T), nodal (N), and metastatic (M) staging (TNM staging).
Evidence acquisition
We performed a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE and Web of Science databases between 2012 and 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines.
Evidence synthesis
A total of 139 studies (83 on T, 47 on N, and 24 on M status) were included. Ninety-nine (71\%) were retrospective, 39 (28\%) were prospective, and one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Most studies on T staging examined MRI, while PET/CT was used primarily for N and M staging. Sensitivity for the detection of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymph node invasion ranged widely. When imaging was incorporated into existing risk tools, gain in accuracy was observed in some studies, although these findings have not been replicated. For M staging, most favorable results were reported for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, which demonstrated significantly better performance than conventional imaging.
Conclusions
A variety of studies on modern imaging techniques for TNM staging in newly diagnosed PCa exist. For T and N staging, reported sensitivity of imaging modalities such as MRI or PET/CT varied widely due to data heterogeneity, small sample size, and low event rates resulting in large confidence intervals and a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, uniformity in data presentation and standardization on this topic are needed. The most promising technique for M staging, which was evaluated recently in an RCT, is PSMA-PET/CT.
Patient summary
We performed a systematic review of currently available imaging modalities to stage newly diagnosed prostate cancer. With respect to local tumor and lymph node assessment, performance of imaging ranged widely. However, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed favorable results for the detection of distant metastases.},

	abstract = {PURPOSEWe report the clinical outcomes of a randomized trial comparing prophylactic whole-pelvic nodal radiotherapy to prostate-only radiotherapy (PORT) in high-risk prostate cancer.METHODSThis phase III, single center, randomized controlled trial enrolled eligible patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for node-negative prostate adenocarcinoma, with estimated nodal risk ≥ 20\%. Randomization was 1:1 to PORT (68 Gy/25\# to prostate) or whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT, 68 Gy/25\# to prostate, 50 Gy/25\# to pelvic nodes, including common iliac) using computerized stratified block randomization, stratified by Gleason score, type of androgen deprivation, prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, and prior transurethral resection of the prostate. All patients received image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and minimum 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary end point was 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTSFrom November 2011 to August 2017, a total of 224 patients were randomly assigned (PORT = 114, WPRT = 110). At a median follow-up of 68 months, 36 biochemical failures (PORT = 25, WPRT = 7) and 24 deaths (PORT = 13, WPRT = 11) were recorded. Five-year BFFS was 95.0\% (95\% CI, 88.4 to 97.9) with WPRT versus 81.2\% (95\% CI, 71.6 to 87.8) with PORT, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.23 (95\% CI, 0.10 to 0.52; P {\textless} .0001). WPRT also showed higher 5-year DFS (89.5\% v 77.2\%; HR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.22 to 0.73; P = .002), but 5-year OS did not appear to differ (92.5\% v 90.8\%; HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 2.05; P = .83). Distant metastasis-free survival was also higher with WPRT (95.9\% v 89.2\%; HR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 0.82; P = .01). Benefit in BFFS and DFS was maintained across prognostic subgroups.CONCLUSIONProphylactic pelvic irradiation for high-risk, locally advanced prostate cancer improved BFFS and DFS as compared with PORT, but OS did not appear to differ.},

The histological frequency and distribution of cervical lymph node metastases was studied in 326 neck dissections from 253 patients with an intraoral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Metastasis was evident in 118 patients (47\%) and 18 had bilateral metastasis. For primary sites other than the tongue, metastasis developed initially in a node(s) in the first drainage group (level I or II) with progressive involvement of neighbouring nodes (‘overflow’). Simultaneous bilateral metastases were seen in some tumours of the floor of mouth, tongue and oropharynx which involved the midline. An erratic distribution of metastases suggestive of ‘fast-tracking’ (skip lesions and peppering) was only seen in tongue tumours. The pattern of metastatic spread indicates that level IV nodes must be included in staging and therapeutic neck dissections in tongue cancer. Metastasis to ‘accessory’ lymph nodes (lingual, buccal) occurs infrequently but may explain some ‘local’ recurrences.},

	abstract = {Abstract A retrospective review of 333 previously untreated patients from 1965 to 1986, with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of neck node metastases by neck level. The 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the NO neck (N = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the N+ neck (N = 259). Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. This revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels II, III, and IV for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. Isolated ?skip? metastases outside of levels II, III, or IV occurred in only 1 patient (0.3\%). Otherwise, level I or V involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, N2 disease). These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in NO patients. Furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.},

	abstract = {Many tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) spread along the lymphatic network. Current imaging modalities can only detect sufficiently large metastases. Therefore, adjacent lymph node levels (LNL) are irradiated electively since they may harbor microscopic tumors. We apply Bayesian Networks (BN) to model lymphatic tumor progression. The model can subsequently be used to personalize the risk estimation of microscopic lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed patients based on their distribution of macroscopic metastases. A BN is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution. We represent LNLs by binary random variables corresponding to the BN nodes. Each LNL is associated with a hidden microscopic state and an observed macroscopic state (e.g. 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging). The primary tumor is represented by network input nodes. We demonstrate the concept for early T-stage oropharyngeal carcinomas and their spread to ipsilateral lymph node levels (LNL) Ib to IV. We show that the BN parameters can be efficiently learnt by merging pathology findings on microscopic tumor progression (which is limited to a few published studies) and imaging data on macroscopic tumor progression such as CT and 18F-FDG-PET (which are widely available in clinical practice). The trained network can be used to quantify how the distribution of macroscopic metastases impacts the probability of microscopic involvement of the remaining LNLs. The analysis suggests that the risk of microscopic involvement of level IV exceeds 5\% only if level III harbors metastases. Excluding level IV from the elective CTV for other patients would reduce the integral dose delivered to the patient and potentially reduce acute and late side effects.},

Detailed examination of these proposals however revealed some important discrepancies. Materials and methods: Within this framework, the Brussels and Rotterdam groups decided to review their guidelines and derive a common set of recommendations for delineation of neck node levels. This proposal was then discussed with representatives of major cooperative groups in Europe (DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC) and in North America (NCIC, RTOG), which, after some additional refinements, have endorsed them. The objective of the present article is to present the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in the node-negative neck. Results and conclusions: First a short discussion of the discrepancies between the previous Brussels and the Rotterdam guidelines is presented. The general philosophy of the consensus guidelines and the methodology used to resolve the various discrepancies are then described. The consensus proposal is then presented and representative CTVs that are consistent with these guidelines are illustrated on CT sections.

	abstract = {Purpose: We present the guidelines for target volume determination and delineation of head-and-neck lymph nodes based on the analysis of the patterns of nodal failure in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Data pertaining to the natural course of nodal metastasis for each head-and-neck cancer subsite were reviewed. A system was established to provide guidance for nodal target volume determination and delineation. Following these guidelines, 126 patients (52 definitive, 74 postoperative) were treated between February 1997 and December 2000 with IMRT for head-and-neck cancer. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 12–55), and the patterns of nodal failure were analyzed. Results: These guidelines define the nodal target volume based on the location of the primary tumor and the probability of microscopic metastasis to the ipsilateral and contralateral (Level I–V) nodal regions. Following these guidelines, persistent or recurrent nodal disease was found in 6 (12\%) of 52 patients receiving definitive IMRT, and 7 (9\%) of 74 patients receiving postoperative IMRT had failure in the nodal region. Conclusion: On the basis of our clinical experience in implementing inverse-planning IMRT for head-and-neck cancer, we present guidelines using a simplified, but clinically relevant, method for nodal target volume determination and delineation. The intention was to provide a foundation that enables different institutions to exchange clinical experiences in head-and-neck IMRT. These guidelines will be subject to future refinement when the clinical experience in head-and-neck IMRT advances.},

The tightly conformal doses produced by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and the lack of internal organ motion in the head and neck, provide the potential for organ sparing and improved tumor irradiation. Many studies of treatment planning for head and neck cancer have demonstrated the dosimetric superiority of IMRT over conventional techniques in these respects. The initial results of clinical studies demonstrate reduced xerostomia. They suggest an improvement in tumor control, which needs to be verified in larger studies and longer follow-up. Critical issues for successful outcome of head and neck IMRT are accurate selection of the neck lymph nodes that require adjuvant treatment, and accurate delineation on the planning computed tomography (CT) of the lymph-node bearing areas and subclinical disease adjoining the gross tumor.

	abstract = {Background and purpose
In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines regarding the delineation of the neck node levels (Radiother Oncol, 2003; 69: 227–36). These recommendations were applicable for the node-negative and the N1-neck, but were found too restrictive for the node-positive and the post-operative neck.
Patients and methods
In this framework, using the previous recommendations as a backbone, new guidelines have been proposed taking into account the specificities of the node-positive and the post-operative neck.
Results
Inclusion of the retrostyloid space cranially and the supra-clavicular fossa caudally is proposed in case of neck nodes (defined radiologically or on the surgical specimen) located in levels II, and IV or Vb, respectively. When extra-capsular rupture is suspected (on imaging) or demonstrated on the pathological specimen, adjacent muscles should also be included in the CTV. For node(s) located at the boundary between contiguous levels (e.g. levels II and Ib), these two levels should be delineated. In the post-operative setting, the entire ‘surgical bed’ should be included. Last, the retropharyngeal space should be delineated in case of positive neck from pharyngeal tumors.
Conclusions
The objective of the manuscript is to give a comprehensive description of the new set of guidelines for CTV delineation in the node-positive neck and the post-operative neck, with a complementary atlas of the new anatomical structures to be included.},

To eliminate potential misinterpretation, overlap, and lack of standardization, the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, with input from the Education Committee of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery, has developed a classification system for these procedures. This has now been adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. The classification is based on the following concepts: (1) radical neck dissection is the fundamental procedure with which all other neck dissections are compared, (2) modified radical neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structure(s), (3) selective neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more group(s) of lymph nodes, and (4) extended radical neck dissection denotes removal of one or more additional lymphatic and/or nonlymphatic structure(s). Adherence to the principles of this classification system to describe neck dissection techniques should provide an improved method of communication. Furthermore, the system provides a rational framework on which subsequent terminology can be added.(Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1991;117:601-605)},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the incidence, distribution, and spread pattern of retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN) involvement in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods and Materials: The MR images of 275 patients with newly diagnosed NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Nodes were classiﬁed as metastatic based on size criteria, the presence of nodal necrosis, and extracapsular spread.
Results: Retropharyngeal lymph node involvement was detected in 175 (63.6\%) patients. Metastatic RLNs were seen at the following levels: occipital bone, 24 (9.6\%) nodes; C1, 157 (62.5\%) nodes; C1/2, 40 (15.9\%) nodes; C2, 27 (10.8\%) nodes; C2/3, 1 (0.4\%) node; and C3, 2 (0.8\%) nodes. The incidence of RLN involvement was equal to the incidence of cervical lymph node involvement (81.4\% vs. 81.4\%) in 215 patients with nodal metastases. A signiﬁcantly higher incidence of metastatic RLNs was observed in the presence of oropharynx, prestyloid parapharyngeal space, post-styloid parapharyngeal space, longus colli muscle, medial pterygoid muscle, levator muscle of velum palatini, tensor muscle of velum palatini, Level II node, Level III node, and Level V node involvement. A signiﬁcantly lower incidence of metastatic RLNs was found in T1, N0, and Stage I disease. Conversely, no signiﬁcant difference in the incidence of metastatic RLNs was observed between T1, 2, and, 3; N2 and N3; or Stage II, III, and IV disease.
Conclusions: There is an orderly decrease in the incidence of metastatic lateral RLNs from the C1 to C3 level. Metastatic RLNs associate well with involvement of certain structures in early stage primary tumors and lymph node metastases of the upper jugular chain (Level II, Level III nodes) and the posterior triangle (Level V nodes). Both RLNs and cervical Level II nodes appear to be the ﬁrst-echelon nodes in NPC. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {It would seem logical that patients with nodal metastases low in the neck would fare less well than patients with disease high in the neck. The penultimate UICC classification suggested that neck node level was important although there was no mention of this in the most recent classification. In addition, patients with carcinomas at the various sites would be expected to have different patterns of nodal involvement. Of 3419 patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma on the Liverpool University Head and Neck Unit database, 947 had neck node metastases. The neck node levels were coded as (I)sub-mandibular, (II) above the thyroid notch, (III) below the thyroid notch and (IV) supra-clavicular/posterior triangle nodes. Levels II and III contained the deep jugular chain. The relationship between node level and site and sub-site and survival were analysed with particular emphasis on multivariate methods. The 5-year survival for the whole group was 51\% and survival fell with decreasing node level (I-IV) being 37\% for sub-mandibular nodes, 32\% for deep cervical nodes and 25\% for lower deep cervical nodes. The 18-month survival for supra-clavicular and posterior triangle nodes was 21\%. The difference in survival was significant (x23= 24.42, P {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that as the level of the nodes fell from the sub-mandibular refion to the supra-clavicular region the prognosis worsened (estimate = -0.3378, P = 0.0003). Level II (upper deep cervical) nodes were the most commonly involved with regards to all primary sites and formed 69\% of all neck node metastases. Over three quarters of laryngeal oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal metastases went ot this level whereas only 47\% of oral cancers did. Most of the remainder of these latter lesions metastasized to level I (42\%). These findings were confirmed by multiple logistic regression. When studying survival for lymph node level with regard to site all sites had a reducing prognosis with decrasing node level except for larynx. Multiple linear regression showed an association between decreasing node level and increasing N-stage (P = 0.001) with increasing T-stage (P = 0.0014) and as the site moved from the mouth to the larynx (P = 0.0047). The present data support the view that neck node level is important as regards prognosis for most sites in the head and neck. The data confirm the clinical view that deep cervical nodes are most frequently affected by head and neck cancer with level IV nodes being unusual and clinically tending to herald a non head and neck tumour and that level III nodes are relatively uncommon. This is surprising as one would expect at least a proportion of laryngeal carcinomas and quite a high proportion of lhypopharyngeal carcinomas to metastasize to this region.},

	abstract = {Background: The characteristics of cervical lymphatic metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are not completely understood. As such, radiotherapy to the entire lymphatic of the neck bilaterally has been empirically practiced even in early stage disease, although not supported by clinical evidence. We studied the pattern and probability of nodal metastasis through a meta-analysis of published evidences, with an aim to establish an evidence-based guideline for selecting and delineation of clinical target volume of neck lymphatics for conformation radiation for NPC.
Methods: A literature search yielded an initial 411 original articles, and 13 studies with 2920 NPC cases staged via MRI were included in this analysis. The occurrence of nodal metastasis was calculated and analyzed according to the respective regional nodal levels.
Results: 85\% of NPC cases presented with lymphadenopathy. The most commonly involved regions include retropharyngeal (69\%) and level II lymph nodes (70\%). The overall probability of levels III, IV, and V nodal involvement are 45\%, 11\%, and 27\%, respectively. Low-risk node groups included the supraclavicular, levels IA/IB and VI nodes, and parotid nodes with involvement rates at 3\%, 0\%, 3\%, 0\%, and 1\%, respectively. Nodal metastases followed an orderly pattern and the probability of “skip” metastasis between levels varied between 0.5-7.9\%.
Conclusions: Lymph node metastasis in NPC follows a predictable and orderly pattern. The rarity of metastasis in certain nodal groups and “skip” metastasis suggest that reduced treatment volume is feasible in conformal radiotherapy for NPC.},

	abstract = {A retrospective review of the records of 501 previously untreated patients from January 1, 1965 through December 31, 1986 with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of ipsilateral neck node metastases (NM) by neck level. The 501 patients underwent 516 radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection (ED) in the NO neck, immediate therapeutic dissection (ITD) in the N+ neck, and subsequent therapeutic dissection (STD) in the neck observed which converted clinically to N+. Pathologically identified NM occurred 34\% of the time in ED, 69\% in ITD and 90\% in STD. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the clinical exam was 70\%, 65\%, and 68\%, respectively. Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the primary site. This revealed a prevalence of NM in level IV of 3\% (five of 167) for ED versus 17\% (49/ 296) for ITD + STD (P {\textless} 0.001). Tongue, retromolar trigone, and cheek did not have NM in level V in any group. The prevalence of NM in level V for floor of mouth or gum primaries was {\textless} 1\% (one of 109) in ED versus 6\% (ten of 167) in ITD + STD (P {\textless} 0.03). These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection in both NO and N+ patients. Further, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection.},

	abstract = {The incidence of occult cervical metastasis in oral cavity cancer, even in early stages, is signiﬁcant, necessitating elective treatment of the neck in a majority of cases. There is no method of imaging or other examination that will detect microscopic foci of metastatic disease in cervical lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of neck specimens reveals the incidence of occult metastases to be higher than revealed by light microscopy with ordinary hematoxylin and eosin staining. The neck may be treated electively by surgery or irradiation. Surgery has the advantage of permitting pathological staging of the neck, avoiding unnecessary radiation treatment and indicating cases where adjuvant therapy should be employed. As oral cavity cancer rarely metastasizes to level V, a radical or modiﬁed radical neck dissection of all ﬁve node levels is not necessary. Selective dissection of levels I–III (“supraomohyoid neck dissection”) is the usual procedure of choice for elective dissection of the neck. Most of the relatively small number of isolated metastasis to level IV are from primary tumours of the tongue, which are known to produce “skip” metastases. Thus an “extended supraomohyoid neck dissection” of levels I–IV is recommended by some authors for elective treatment of the neck in tongue cancer. A number of recent prospective multi-institutional studies have demonstrated that sublevel IIB is rarely involved with isolated metastasis from oral cavity primary tumours, except from some tongue cancers. Thus it is justiﬁable to omit dissection of sublevel IIB in elective treatment of most cases of oral cavity cancer. Bilateral neck dissection should be performed in elective treatment of tumours involving midline structures, and in patients with ipsilateral neck metastasis.},

Results. The mean age was 59 years with male-to-female sex ratio of 1.4:1. Two hundred sixty-one neck dissections were performed with SMG removal in 253 patients. One patient with an advanced ﬂoor of mouth cancer had obvious inﬁltration of the SMG. Only 2.5\% (3 of 116) patients with early-stage OSCC had level I metastasis; none had SMG metastases.
Conclusion. SMG preservation in early cancers (T1-2, N0) of the oral cavity should be feasible unless there is evidence of direct invasion of the gland or close proximity of the cancer to it. VC 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 31: 1619–1623, 2009},

	abstract = {One practical problem with building large scale Bayesian network models is an expo- nential growth of the number of numerical parameters in conditional probability tables. Obtaining large number of probabilities from domain experts is too expensive and too time demanding in practice. A widely accepted solution to this problem is the assumption of independence of causal influences (ICI) which allows for parametric models that define conditional probability distributions using only a number of parameters that is linear in the number of causes. ICI models, such as the noisy-OR and the noisy-AND gates, have been widely used by practitioners. In this paper we propose PICI, probabilistic ICI, an extension of the ICI assumption that leads to more expressive parametric models. We provide examples of three PICI models and demonstrate how they can cope with a com- bination of positive and negative influences, something that is hard for noisy-OR and noisy-AND gates.},

The sensitivity varied substantially according to sex (women 30\% and men 64\%), systolic blood pressure at baseline (53\% to 65\%), expected workload (50\% to 64\%), systolic blood pressure at peak exercise (50\% to 67\%), relative workload (33\% to 66\%), and number of diseased vessels (39\% to 77\%). The specificity varied across subgroups of sex (men 89\% and women 97\%) and relative workload (85\% to 98\%). The likelihood ratio varied (3.8 to 17.0) across the same patient subgroups, as did the sensitivity. As each population tends to be heterogeneous with respect to patient characteristics, no single level of these parameters can be given that is adequate for all subgroups. Use of these parameters as a basis for calculating diagnostic probabilities in individual patients using Bayes' theorem has serious limitations.},

	abstract = {We conduct a theoretical study of various solution methods for the adaptive fractionation problem. The two messages of this paper are: (i) dynamic programming (DP) is a useful framework for adaptive radiation therapy, particularly adaptive fractionation, because it allows us to assess how close to optimal different methods are, and (ii) heuristic methods proposed in this paper are near-optimal, and therefore, can be used to evaluate the best possible benefit of using an adaptive fraction size. The essence of adaptive fractionation is to increase the fraction size when the tumor and organ-at-risk (OAR) are far apart (a "favorable" anatomy) and to decrease the fraction size when they are close together. Given that a fixed prescribed dose must be delivered to the tumor over the course of the treatment, such an approach results in a lower cumulative dose to the OAR when compared to that resulting from standard fractionation. We first establish a benchmark by using the DP algorithm to solve the problem exactly. In this case, we characterize the structure of an optimal policy, which provides guidance for our choice of heuristics. We develop two intuitive, numerically near-optimal heuristic policies, which could be used for more complex, high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, one of the heuristics requires only a statistic of the motion probability distribution, making it a reasonable method for use in a realistic setting. Numerically, we find that the amount of decrease in dose to the OAR can vary significantly (5 - 85\%) depending on the amount of motion in the anatomy, the number of fractions, and the range of fraction sizes allowed. In general, the decrease in dose to the OAR is more pronounced when: (i) we have a high probability of large tumor-OAR distances, (ii) we use many fractions (as in a hyper-fractionated setting), and (iii) we allow large daily fraction size deviations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP-SCC), the prevalence and distribution of clinical and pathological lymph node metastasis in the neck have been extensively reported. It served as the basis for consensus recommendations on the selection of the lymph node levels in the neck requiring a treatment. The objective of the study is to compare the prevalence and distribution of neck node metastases in HPV+ and HPV- OP-SCC from a large series of patients with OP-SCC who underwent a cervical lymph-node dissection (LND) as part of their treatment.
METHODS: The study concentrated on OP-SCC patients treated by various neck node dissection (LND) procedures from January 2014 to December 2018 in 3 French institutions. Patients with prior head and neck cancer, prior neck surgery, the use of induction chemotherapy, or patients with carcinoma of unknown primary were excluded. HPV-status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry. For each patient, the clinical and the pathological nodal status, as well as the distribution of the positive nodes in each neck level (from Ia to V) were reported.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixty-three patients were included (126 p16-negative (p16-), and 137 p16-positive (p16+). The rate of clinical positive node (cN+) reached 54\% and 88.3\% in the p16- and p16+ groups, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001); the corresponding rate of pathological positive node (pN+) reached 61.9\% and 91.2\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Regarding the clinical lymph node distribution, in p16+ patients, more positive nodes were observed in the ipsilateral level IV (p = 0.003), and less positive nodes were observed in the contralateral levels III and IV (p = 0.003 and p = 0.045, respectively). Regarding the pathologic lymph node distribution in the ipsilateral neck, in the cN0 patients, no significant difference was observed between p16- and p16+ patients (p = 0.33 to 1); in the cN+ patients, the nodes were distributed in levels Ib, II, III, IV and V without differences between the p16- and the p16+ patients. In the contralateral neck of p16- patients, nodes metastases were mainly observed in levels II, III and IV, whereas for the p16+ patients, positive nodes were only observed in level II (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the higher prevalence of cN+ and pN+ in p16+ OP-SCC patients, but without meaningful difference in the distribution of the lymph node drainage between p16- and p16+ OP-SCC. It indicates that no difference should be made between p16- and p16+ patients regarding the extend of neck treatment.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Bilateral elective nodal irradiation (ENI) remains the standard treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Unilateral ENI could reduce treatment toxicity and improve health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL). This prospective proof-of-principle trial (NCT02572661) investigated the feasibility, safety and clinical beneﬁts of SPECT/CT-guided ENI of the node-negative contralateral neck. Materials and methods: Patients with lateralized T1-3N0-2bM0 HNSCC of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx underwent SPECT/CT after peritumoral 99mTc-nanocolloid injection. Patients without contralateral lymph drainage received ipsilateral ENI only. If lymph drainage to only one contralateral hot spot was visible, ENI to the contralateral neck would be limited to only the level containing the hot spot. The primary endpoint was the incidence of contralateral regional failure (CRF) at 2 years. Toxicity and HRQOL were compared with a 1:1 matched historical cohort that received standard bilateral ENI (B-ENI) with identical planning and treatment techniques.
Results: Fifty patients were treated with SPECT/CT-guided ENI. After a median follow-up of 33 months (range 18–45), CRF was observed in one patient (2\%; 95\% conﬁdence interval: 0–6\%). Compared to the matched B-ENI group, patients treated with SPECT/CT-guided ENI had signiﬁcantly lower incidences of grade !2 dysphagia (54\% vs. 82\%; p {\textless} 0.001), tube feeding (10\% vs. 50\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and late grade !2 xerostomia (9\% vs. 54\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Signiﬁcant and clinically relevant HRQOL beneﬁts of SPECT/CTguided ENI were observed on the EORTC QLQ-C30 summary score, and QLQ-HN35 swallowing and dry mouth subscales.
Conclusion: SPECT/CT-guided ENI is associated with a low risk of contralateral regional failure. Compared to B-ENI, SPECT/CT-guided ENI signiﬁcantly reduces dysphagia, feeding tube placement, and late xerostomia and improves HRQOL.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Currently, elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) definition for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is mostly based on the prevalence of nodal involvement for a given tumor location. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model for lymphatic metastatic spread that can quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in lymph node levels (LNL) given the location of macroscopic metastases and T-category. This may allow for further personalized CTV-N definition based on an individual patient’s state of disease. We model the patient's state of metastatic lymphatic progression as a collection of hidden binary random variables that indicate the involvement of LNLs. In addition, each LNL is associated with observed binary random variables that indicate whether macroscopic metastases are detected. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to compute the probabilities of transitions between states over time. The underlying graph of the HMM represents the anatomy of the lymphatic drainage system. Learning of the transition probabilities is done via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and is based on a dataset of HNSCC patients in whom involvement of individual LNLs was reported. The model is demonstrated for ipsilateral metastatic spread in oropharyngeal HNSCC patients. We demonstrate the model's capability to quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in levels III and IV, depending on whether macroscopic metastases are observed in the upstream levels II and III, and depending on T-category. In conclusion, the statistical model of lymphatic progression may inform future, more personalized, guidelines on which LNL to include in the elective CTV. However, larger multi-institutional datasets for model parameter learning are required for that.},

	title = {Detailed patient-individual reporting of lymph node involvement in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with an online interface},
	abstract = {Purpose/Objective: Whereas the prevalence of lymph node level (LNL) involvement in head \& neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has been reported, the details of lymphatic progression patterns are insufficiently quantified. In this study, we investigate how the risk of metastases in each LNL depends on the involvement of upstream LNLs, T-category, HPV status and other risk factors. 
Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal HNSCC treated at a single institution, resulting in a dataset of 287 patients. For all patients, involvement of LNLs I-VII was recorded individually based on available diagnostic modalities (PET, MR, CT, FNA) together with clinicopathological factors. To analyze the dataset, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed, which allows querying the number of patients with a certain combination of co-involved LNLs and tumor characteristics.
Results: The full dataset and GUI is part of the publication. Selected findings are: Ipsilateral level IV was involved in 27\% of patients with level II and III involvement, but only in 2\% of patients with level II but not III involvement. Prevalence of involvement of ipsilateral levels II, III, IV, V was 79\%, 34\%, 7\%, 3\% for early T-category patients (T1/T2) and 85\%, 50\%, 17\%, 9\% for late T-category (T3/T4), quantifying increasing involvement with T-category. Contralateral levels II, III, IV were involved in 41\%, 19\%, 4\% and 12\%, 3\%, 2\% for tumors for tumors with and without midline extension, respectively. T-stage dependence of LNL involvement was more pronounced in HPV negative than positive tumors, but overall involvement was similar. Ipsilateral level VII was involved in 14\% and 6\% of patients with primary tumors in the tonsil and the base of tongue, respectively.
Conclusions: Detailed quantification of LNL involvement in HNSCC depending on involvement of upstream LNLs and clinicopathological factors may allow for further personalization of CTV-N definition in the future.},

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of RPLN involvement upon outcomes. A single-centre retrospective analysis of 402 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma treated nonsurgically between 2010 and 2017 was performed. All had a baseline 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) PET-CT and contrast-enhanced MRI and/or CT. RPLN status was determined by radiology review of cases with reported abnormal RPLN. Multivariate backwards logistic regression was used to examine impact on outcomes of factors. Abnormal RPLNs were identified in 40/402 (10\%) of patients. Median follow up was 42.9 months. RPLN involvement was associated with inferior 3 year outcomes for overall survival (OS) (67.1\% vs. 79.1\%, p = 0.006) and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) (73.9\% versus 88.0\%, p = 0.011), with no significant difference in local control (81.6\% vs. 87.7\%, p = 0.154) or regional control (80.7\% vs. 85.4\%, p = 0.252). On multivariate analysis abnormal RPLN, no concurrent chemotherapy and ongoing smoking were associated with inferior DMFS and OS, while advanced T stage was also associated with inferior OS. In summary, RPLN involvement, present in 10\% of patients, was an independent prognostic factor for the development of distant disease failure translating into inferior OS. These findings need confirmation in future studies.},

With SCP, each institution specifies other institutions with which to remain in agreement; through the global interconnectedness of the financial system, the whole network then agrees on atomic transactions spanning arbitrary institutions, with no solvency or exchange-rate risk from intermediary asset issuers or market makers.

	abstract = {Vibratory stimuli are thought to have the potential to promote neural and/or muscular (re)conditioning. This has been well described for whole-body vibration (WBV), which is commonly used as a training method to improve strength and/or functional abilities. Yet, this technique may present some limitations, especially in clinical settings where patients are unable to maintain an active position during the vibration exposure. Thus, a local vibration (LV) technique, which consists of applying portable vibrators directly over the tendon or muscle belly without active contribution from the participant, may present an alternative to WBV. The purpose of this narrative review is (1) to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature related to the acute and chronic neuromuscular changes associated with LV, and (2) to show that LV training may be an innovative and efficient alternative method to the ‘classic’ training programs, including in the context of muscle deconditioning prevention or rehabilitation. An acute LV application (one bout of 20–60 min) may be considered as a significant neuromuscular workload, as demonstrated by an impairment of force generating capacity and LV-induced neural changes. Accordingly, it has been reported that a training period of LV is efficient in improving muscular performance over a wide range of training (duration, number of session) and vibration (frequency, amplitude, site of application) parameters. The functional improvements are principally triggered by adaptations within the central nervous system. A model illustrating the current research on LV-induced adaptations is provided.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) and local muscle vibration (LMV) on quadriceps function after experimental knee effusion (ie, simulated pathology).
Design
Randomized controlled trial.
Setting
Research laboratory.
Participants
Healthy volunteers (N=43) were randomized to WBV (n=14), LMV (n=16), or control (n=13) groups.
Interventions
Saline was injected into the knee to induce quadriceps arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI). All groups then performed isometric squats while being exposed to WBV, LMV, or no vibration (control).
Main Outcome Measures
Quadriceps function was assessed at baseline, immediately after effusion, and immediately and 5 minutes after each intervention (WBV, LMV, control) via voluntary peak torque (VPT) and the central activation ratio (CAR) during maximal isometric knee extension on a multifunction dynamometer.
Results
The CAR improved in the WBV (11.4\%, P=.021) and LMV (7.3\%, P{\textless}.001) groups immediately postintervention, but they did not improve in the control group. Similarly, VPT increased by 16.5\% (P=.021) in the WBV group and 23\% (P=.078) in the LMV group immediately postintervention, but it did not increase in the control group. The magnitudes of improvements in the CAR and VPT did not differ between the WBV and LMV groups.
Conclusions
Quadriceps AMI is a common complication following knee pathology that produces quadriceps dysfunction and increases the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Quadriceps strengthening after knee pathology is often ineffective because of AMI. WBV and LMV improve quadriceps function equivocally after simulated knee pathology, effectively minimizing quadriceps AMI. Therefore, these stimuli may be used to enhance quadriceps strengthening, therefore improving the efficacy of rehabilitation and reducing the risk of osteoarthritis.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-wk local vibration training (LVT) program on functional and corticospinal properties of dorsiflexor muscles. Forty-four young subjects were allocated to a training (VIB, n = 22) or control (CON, n = 22) group. The VIB group performed twenty-four 1-h sessions (3 sessions/wk) of 100-Hz vibration applied to the right tibialis anterior. Both legs were tested in each group before training (PRE), after 4 (MID) and 8 (POST) wk of training, and 2 wk after training (POST2W). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was assessed, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate cortical voluntary activation (VATMS), motor evoked potential (MEP), cortical silent period (CSP), and input-output curve parameters. MVC was significantly increased for VIB at MID for right and left legs [+7.4\% (P = 0.001) and +6.2\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively] and remained significantly greater than PRE at POST [+12.0\% (P {\textless} 0.001) and +10.1\% (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively]. VATMS was significantly increased for right and left legs at MID [+4.4\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and +4.7\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively] and at POST [+4.9\% (P = 0.001) and +6.2\% (P = 0.001), respectively]. These parameters remained enhanced in both legs at POST2W. MEP and CSP recorded during MVC and input-output curve parameters did not change at any time point for either leg. Despite no changes in excitability or inhibition being observed, LVT seems to be a promising method to improve strength through an increase of maximal voluntary activation, i.e., neural adaptations. Local vibration may thus be further considered for clinical or aging populations.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The effects of a local vibration training program on cortical voluntary activation measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation were assessed for the first time in dorsiflexors, a functionally important muscle group. We observed that training increased maximal voluntary strength likely because of the strong and repeated activation of Ia spindle afferents during vibration training that led to changes in the cortico-motoneuronal pathway, as demonstrated by the increase in cortical voluntary activation.},

	abstract = {Purpose/Objective Whereas the prevalence of lymph node level (LNL) involvement in head \& neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has been reported, the details of lymphatic progression patterns are insufficiently quantified. In this study, we investigate how the risk of metastases in each LNL depends on the involvement of upstream LNLs, T-category, HPV status and other risk factors.
Materials/Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal HNSCC treated at a single institution, resulting in a dataset of 287 patients. For all patients, involvement of LNLs I-VII was recorded individually based on available diagnostic modalities (PET, MR, CT, FNA) together with clinicpathological factors. To analyze the dataset, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed, which allows querying the number of patients with a certain combination of co-involved LNLs and tumor characteristics.
Results The full dataset and GUI is part of the publication. Selected findings are: Ipsilateral level IV was involved in 27\% of patients with level II and III involvement, but only in 2\% of patients with level II but not III involvement. Prevalence of involvement of ipsilateral levels II, III, IV, V was 79\%, 34\%, 7\%, 3\% for early T-category patients (T1/T2) and 85\%, 50\%, 17\%, 9\% for late T-category (T3/T4), quantifying increasing involvement with T-category. Contralateral levels II, III, IV were involved in 41\%, 19\%, 4\% and 12\%, 3\%, 2\% for tumors for tumors with and without midline extension, respectively. T-stage dependence of LNL involvement was more pronounced in HPV negative than positive tumors, but overall involvement was similar. Ipsilateral level VII was involved in 14\% and 6\% of patients with primary tumors in the tonsil and the base of tongue, respectively.
Conclusions Detailed quantification of LNL involvement in HNSCC depending on involvement of upstream LNLs and clinicopathological factors may allow for further personalization of CTV-N definition in the future.},

	abstract = {The group testing problem concerns discovering a small number of defective items within a large population by performing tests on pools of items. A test is positive if the pool contains at least one defective, and negative if it contains no defectives. This is a sparse inference problem with a combinatorial flavour, with applications in medical testing, biology, telecommunications, information technology, data science, and more. In this monograph, we survey recent developments in the group testing problem from an information-theoretic perspective. We cover several related developments: efficient algorithms with practical storage and computation requirements, achievability bounds for optimal decoding methods, and algorithm-independent converse bounds. We assess the theoretical guarantees not only in terms of scaling laws, but also in terms of the constant factors, leading to the notion of the \{{\textbackslash}em rate\} of group testing, indicating the amount of information learned per test. Considering both noiseless and noisy settings, we identify several regimes where existing algorithms are provably optimal or near-optimal, as well as regimes where there remains greater potential for improvement. In addition, we survey results concerning a number of variations on the standard group testing problem, including partial recovery criteria, adaptive algorithms with a limited number of stages, constrained test designs, and sublinear-time algorithms.},

Information on the protein is scarce, because of its high tendency of aggregation. We determined suitable conditions to produce a functional human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 L2 protein and thereby provide the opportunity for extensive in vitro analysis with respect to structural and biochemical information on L2 proteins and mechanistic details in viral entry. We produced the L2 protein of high-risk HPV 16 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and purified the protein under denaturing conditions. A successive buffer screen resulted in suitable conditions for the biophysical characterization of 16L2. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the refolded protein showed a homogenous monomeric species. Furthermore, refolded 16L2 shows secondary structure elements. The N-terminal region including the proposed transmembrane region of 16L2 shows alpha-helical characteristics. However, overall 16L2 appears largely unstructured. Refolded 16L2 is capable of binding to DNA indicating that the putative DNA-binding regions are accessible in refolded 16L2. Further the refolded protein interacts with liposomal membranes presumably via the proposed transmembrane region at neutral pH without structural changes. This indicates that 16L2 can initially interact with membranes via pre-existing structural features.},

	abstract = {Dataset
We provide a dataset on lymph node level (LNL) involvement in 287 patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). For each patient, ipsilateral and contralateral LNL involvement for levels I to VII is reported together with clinicopathological factors including TNM-stage, primary tumor subsite, tumor lateralization, HPV status, sex, age, smoking status, and primary treatment. LNL involvement was assessed individually based on available diagnostic modalities (PET, MRI, CT, fine needle aspiration) by reviewing pathology and radiology reports together with the radiological images. The data is shared as a CSV-table with rows of patients and columns of patient/tumor-specific information and the involvement of individual LNL based on the respective diagnostic modalities.
Reuse potential
Patterns of lymphatic progression have never been reported on a patient-individual basis in as much detail as provided in this dataset. The data can be used to build quantitative models for lymphatic tumor progression to estimate the probability of occult metastases in LNLs. This may in turn allow for further personalization of the elective clinical target volume definition in radiotherapy and the extent of neck dissection for surgically treated patients. The data can be pooled with other data to build large multi-institutional datasets on lymphatic metastatic progression in the future.

	abstract = {We consider the design of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large-scale, distributed, heterogeneous compute facilities, with a focus on synthesising sample sets across multiple runs performed in parallel. While theory suggests that many independent Markov chains may be run and their samples pooled, the well-known practical problem of quasi-ergodicity, or poor mixing, frustrates this otherwise simple approach. Furthermore, without some mechanism for hastening the convergence of individual chains, overall speedup from parallelism is limited by the portion of each chain to be discarded as burn-in. Existing multiple-chain methods, such as parallel tempering and population MCMC, use a synchronous exchange of samples to expedite convergence. This work instead proposes mixing in an additional independent proposal, representing some hitherto best estimate or summary of the posterior, and cooperatively adapting this across chains. Such adaptation can be asynchronous, increases the ensemble’s robustness to quasi-ergodic behaviour in constituent chains, and may improve overall tolerance to fault.},

	abstract = {A major problem with silicon solar cells is that they lose efﬁciency with increased operating temperature, at a rate of about 0.5\% per 1◦C increase. This causes a signiﬁcant reduction in power output, particularly in hot climates. A solution in the form of an optical coating is presented, which reﬂects infrared (IR) radiation to limit the module temperature increase. The optical coating is also anti-reﬂecting (AR) in the visible wavelength range, increasing the amount of light reaching the cell absorber. Modelling results show that the weighted average reﬂection (WAR) is reduced to 1.22\% in the wavelength range associated with the band gap of silicon. The optical coating then reﬂects up to 70\% of the infra-red. Although the model presented is based on silicon, the coating design can be modiﬁed to work with other photovoltaic technologies. The coating design uses only 4 layers and can be deposited using conventional high throughput magnetron sputtering systems already familiar to glass manufacturers. Preliminary work on optimising the coating deposition parameters is also presented here alongside modelling results. Deployment of the infra-red reﬂecting optical coating on solar cover glass represents a potential breakthrough in solar technology and will result in a signiﬁcant increase in the power output of photovoltaic modules.},

	abstract = {The usefulness of PET/MRI in head and neck malignancy has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and confidence of PET/MRI in comparison with PET or MRI alone. This study included 73 consecutive patients who underwent [18F] FDG PET/MRI in head and neck under the suspicion of malignancy. A neuroradiologist and a nuclear medicine specialist reviewed MRI and PET images, respectively and independently, followed by a consensus review of PET/MRI one month later. For 134 lesions, accuracy and confidence were compared among PET, MRI, and PET/MRI. For lesion base, PET/MRI had a sensitivity of 85.7\%, a specificity of 89.1\%, a PPV of 89.6\%, a negative predictive value of 85.1\%, and an accuracy of 87.3\%. AUCs of PET/MRI per lesion (0.926) and per patient (0.934) for diagnosing malignancy were higher than PET (0.847 and 0.747, respectively) or MRI (0.836 and 0.798, respectively) alone (P {\textless} 0.05). More than 80\% of the cases (111/134) showed diagnostic concordance between PET and MRI. PPV of PET/MRI was higher in malignant concordant cases (93.2\%, 55/59) than in discordant cases (62.5\%, 5/8) (p = 0.040). Confident scoring rate in malignant concordant cases was higher on PET/MRI (96.6\%, 57/59) than on MRI (76.3\%, 45/59) (p = 0.003). In conclusion, compared with PET or MRI alone, PET/MRI presents better diagnostic performance in accuracy and confidence for diagnosis of malignancy. PET/MRI is useful in patients with head and neck cancer.},

	abstract = {The definition of tumor involved volumes in patients with head and neck cancer poses great challenges with the increasing use of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques eg, volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity modulated proton therapy. The risk of underdosing the tumor might increase unless great care is taken in the process. The information gained from imaging is increasing with both PET and MRI becoming readily available for the definition of targets. The information gained from these techniques is indeed multidimensional as one often acquire data on eg, metabolism, diffusion, and hypoxia together with anatomical and structural information. Nevertheless, much work remains to fully exploit the available information on a patient-specific level. Multimodality target definition in radiotherapy is a chain of processes that must be individually scrutinized, optimized and quality assured. Any uncertainties or errors in image acquisition, reconstruction, interpretation, and delineation are systematic errors and hence will potentially have a detrimental effect on the entire radiotherapy treatment and hence; the chance of cure or the risk of unnecessary side effects. Common guidelines and procedures create a common minimum standard and ground for evaluation and development. In Denmark, the treatment of head and neck cancer is organized within the multidisciplinary Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA). The radiotherapy quality assurance group of DAHANCA organized a workshop in January 2020 with participants from oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine from all centers in Denmark, treating patients with head and neck cancer. The participants agreed on a national guideline on imaging for target delineation in head and neck cancer radiotherapy, which has been approved by the DAHANCA group. The guidelines are available in the Supplementary. The use of multimodality imaging is being recommended for the planning of all radical treatments with a macroscopic tumor. 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT should be available, preferable in the treatment position. The recommended MRI sequences are T1, T2 with and without fat suppression, and T1 with contrast enhancement, preferable in the treatment position. The interpretation of clinical information, including thorough physical examination as well as imaging, should be done in a multidisciplinary setting with an oncologist, radiologist, and nuclear medicine specialist.},

	abstract = {18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography-scan (PET/CT) is used increasingly for detection of cancer. Precise diagnostic assessment of tumour extension in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is of critical importance for ensuring that patients receive proper treatment. Preliminary studies have shown divergent results of PET/CT in diagnosis and staging of HNSCC. The aims of this study were (1) to systematically review and meta-analyse published data about the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT for diagnosing patients with HNSCC and (2) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT with that of standard conventional imaging (SCI).
Methods
A systematic literature search in the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases on publications of PET/CT diagnostics of HNSCC from January 2005 to July 2013 was carried out. All retrieved studies were reviewed and qualitatively analysed. Along with the calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT and SCI, bubble- and summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) plots were created.
Findings
Two meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy were conducted. The first, on PET/CT, included 987 patients distributed across nine studies. The second, on SCI, included 517 patients participating in a total of six studies among those comparing PET/CT to SCI. The meta-analyses showed a pooled sensitivity of 89.3\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 83.4–93.2\%) and specificity of 89.5\% (95\% CI: 82.9–93.7\%) for PET/CT and correspondingly, a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 71.6\% (95\% CI: 44.3–88.9\%) and 78.0\% (95\%CI: 30.2–96.7\%) for SCI. A graphical comparison to SCI showed a clear difference in favour of PET/CT.
Interpretation
PET/CT is highly accurate in diagnosing patients suffering from HNSCC},

Background: Treatment for HPV positive(+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is highly effective but associated with significant short and long term treatment related morbidity. We hypothesize that decreasing the regions of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) in the neck will lead to less toxicity and better quality of life/functional outcomes while maintaining high disease control rates in patients with favourable prognosis HPV+ OSCC. Methods: HN.10 is a Canadian Cancer Trials Group phase II trial with a primary objective to evaluate the efficacy of primary definitive radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) utilizing volume reduced ENI as measured by 2-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients with low-risk HPV+ OPSCC. Secondary objectives include to evaluate overall survival, local control, regional control, locoregional control, out-of-field regional control, distant metastasis free survival, early and late toxicities of treatment, subjective swallowing functions, quality of life, utilization of healthcare resources, work productivity, and prognostic biomarkers. An imaging and biospecimen bank will be compiled as part of trial conduct. Key eligibility criteria include: pathologically proven diagnosis of HPV+ OPSCC; HPV association determined locally by either p16 immunohistochemistry or direct detection of HPV DNA sequences (e.g. by PCR or in situ hybridization) performed on a core needle or surgical biopsy specimen of the primary tumour or involved cervical lymph node; clinical stage T1-3 N0-1 M0 (UICC/AJCC 8th Ed.); fit for radiotherapy +/-chemoradiotherapy. Statistical Design: The primary endpoint is 2-year EFS. Assuming 2-year EFS to be 91\% (Ha) for low-risk HPV-related OPSCC with standard treatment, and that the experimental treatment will be considered as ineffective if the 2-year EFS is ≤ 85\% (H0), with one-sided alpha of 0.1, a sample size of 100 patients will have 80\% power to detect a 6\% difference of 2-year EFS. With 3 years of accrual and 2 years of follow-up, the total duration of this study will be 5 years. A total of 304.7 person-years of follow-up is needed for the final analysis. The null hypothesis (H0) will be rejected when the observed survival rate is 88.85\% or higher (i.e. if there are 18 or fewer EFS events observed).

	abstract = {Background
The head and neck region has rich regional lymphatic network, with a theoretical risk on contralateral metastasis from oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). There is a long-standing convention to irradiate the great majority of these tumors electively to both sides of the neck to reduce the risk of contralateral regional failure (cRF), but this can induce significant toxicity. We aimed to identify patient groups where elective contralateral irradiation may safely be omitted.
Methods
PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original full-text articles in English with a combination of search terms related to the end points: cRF in OPC primarily treated by radiotherapy only to the ipsilateral neck and identifying predictive factors for increased incidence of cRF. The data from the identified studies were pooled, the incidence of cRF was calculated and the correlation with different predictive factors was investigated.
Results
Eleven full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, 1116 patients were treated to the ipsilateral neck alone. The mean incidence of cRF was 2.42\% (range 0–5.9\%, 95\% CI 1.6–3.5\%). The incidence of cRF correlated only with T-stage (p=0.008), and involvement of midline (p=0.001). However, the significant correlation with T-stage can be explained by the very low incidence of cRF among T1 (0.77\%), and disappeared when the incidence of cRF was compared between T2, T3,and T4 (p=0.344).
Conclusion
The incidence of cRF in patients with OPC is very low, with involvement of midline providing the most significant prognosticator. These results call for trials on unilateral elective irradiation in selected groups.},
